All right , so I made another deal .
Don &apos;t lie to me .
I was called away on urgent business , Snake .
Wait a minute .
I know that voice .
You &apos;re Carjack <unk> .
What &apos;s in it for me ?
I need a favor .
The name &apos;s Plissken .
You &apos;re gonna have to learn to respect the law , Snake .
The United States is a <unk> smoking nation .
No smoking , no drinking , do drugs , no women unless you &apos;re married , no guns , no foul language .
It &apos;s a brand new day for you , Snake .
Got a smoke ?
Yeah , I got it .
Plissken - this is <unk> .
Do you have the prototype ?
It &apos;s history .
I gotta go .
Where &apos;s the <unk> ?
It &apos;s disappeared off our screens .
Hands on switches and counting .
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 .
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> to 75 % power .
Lock fuel <unk> .
She &apos;s in the green .
A medical team will be standing by .
By the way - who gives me the <unk> ?
Let &apos;s just say it &apos;s what &apos;s best for the country .
So you want me to take her out ?
Is that an order from the President ?
<unk> Pass .
Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl .
You should be able to pick up <unk> &apos;s <unk> there .
Once you go inside , you &apos;re on your own .
You know what you have to do with the girl , don &apos;t you ?
We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason .
Where do I put ashore ?
All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
So what does this thing do ?
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want .
The Cubans and <unk> are ready to <unk> Miami .
If the <unk> and <unk> make a run at the border , we got a full scale attack on the United States .
There &apos;s a war about to be declared , or didn &apos;t you know ?
<unk> against what ?
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence .
Let &apos;s just say it &apos;s the ultimate defensive weapon .
I &apos;ll need to know more about this thing .
Call me Snake .
I guess we have a deal .
Nice to be working with you , Plissken .
Get this crap out of me .
You don &apos;t understand .
It &apos;s already in you .
Maybe .
But you &apos;re not putting any shit in me this time .
Having second thoughts ?
Wait a minute , what are you talkin &apos; about ?
Tell the President to <unk> .
I think I &apos;ll like L.A. That &apos;s the deal .
So what &apos;s the deal , huh ?
Go into L.A. , find the President &apos;s daughter , secure the box , and bring &apos; em both out - and I &apos;m free ?
That &apos;s right , big shot .
Unless you do what we want you &apos;re not coming back .
And I don &apos;t need to know .
So fuck you , I &apos;m goin &apos; to Hollywood .
Top secret .
Only on a need to know .
What &apos;s the little black box do ?
Shut up , Plissken .
You assholes didn &apos;t bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service .
What &apos;ya want ?
How you doin &apos; Plissken ?
You like the watch ?
You &apos;re free , Plissken .
But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I &apos;ll crush you like a bug .
Relax , war hero .
We took you for a ride , and you came through .
Not bad for a <unk> like you .
Well , yeah .
All you have to do is push the button .
Does he know how to <unk> it ?
The prototype appears to be armed , Mr. President .
Shall I begin <unk> ?
So where &apos;s Plissken ?
Getting ready to <unk> .
I give you my word .
Put the prototype into my hands , and you &apos;re a free man .
It &apos;s the President , for Christ &apos;s sake !
Yeah .
The place kept changing owners .
Finally went bankrupt .
That thing in Paris killed &apos; em .
Is that what I think it is ?
If he lets you get close enough .
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo .
I got an idea , Snake .
This looks like the prototype , right ?
Don &apos;t like it , don &apos;t come .
I don &apos;t know about this thing .
<unk> .
I &apos;m not <unk> &apos; .
I swear to God .
Aw , come on , Snake .
I used to represent the guy who invented it .
I swear to God , Snake .
No bullshit .
How do you know all this ?
Right .
Keep goin &apos; straight .
Two blocks down , turn right .
Cease fire with the bullshit .
I couldn &apos;t help it , Snake .
I had to shoot you .
Cuervo made me do it , I swear to God , man .
Sure , Snake .
No problem .
You gonna kill me ?
Listen up .
I need directions .
<unk> .
Somebody named Hershe .
I could &apos;ve helped you .
We coulda made a deal with Cuervo .
If you &apos;d listen ... Oh , man ... You didn &apos;t have to hit me , Snake .
I can help you .
Where are they going ?
Right over there .
Where is it ?
All right .
Anything for you , Snake .
Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones &apos; place .
I said pull over .
Stop the damn car .
Cuervo Jones &apos; <unk> man .
One tough <unk> .
You don &apos;t understand , Snake .
Cuervo Jones wants to <unk> the island .
We &apos;re on the move , man .
Big time .
Too many people know where you &apos;re going , Snake .
That &apos;s not good .
Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you .
Cuervo &apos;s got a place near Venice , where the big birds fly .
Nice digs , too .
I &apos;ve been there , y &apos;know .
Who ?
You mean Cuervo Jones ?
He &apos;s the man with the juice , Snake .
Got the President &apos;s daughter .
<unk> up a <unk> <unk> .
Big <unk> .
Where are they ?
Man , I &apos;d love to have your autograph , Snake .
Where &apos;d they go ?
You &apos;re a star in your own right , you know that ?
Hey , I &apos;m <unk> To The <unk> Eddie .
How you doin &apos; ?
All the sewers are <unk> under Venice .
You have to go <unk> .
Right up there .
Yeah .
So how do I get to Venice ?
Say , you need anything , Snake ?
Guns ?
<unk> ?
I can get you a crate of <unk> <unk> , no problem - five hours .
Good .
I want you out .
This is my sewer .
Looking to get out .
What &apos;re you doing in here ?
Hershe .
She lives downtown with <unk> <unk> in the big boat .
Down that way .
You ain &apos;t doin &apos; so good , Snake .
You need help .
You should talk to Hershe .
She hates Cuervo .
They used to be partners , but they split up .
<unk> .
Headquarters for everything .
The whole town &apos;s gonna be there .
Things <unk> &apos; fast around here , Snake .
It &apos;s not the same as the old days , man .
Long gone .
You &apos;ll never catch up with him now , Snake .
Where &apos;s ... Cuervo Jones ... ?
Could be a big one comin &apos; any minute now ... Down that way .
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl ?
Kind of a bad neighborhood , Snake .
Run , Snake ... They &apos;re coming .
No !
Stay away , Snake .
He &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
Find Cuervo Jones .
What are you gonna do in Venice ?
It &apos;s where they live .
I guess after everything happened , they just needed to do what they &apos;d always done before .
During the daytime , they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep .
I know that .
There are people in some of these cars .
What the hell is this ?
I changed my mind .
I &apos;m going with you , wherever you &apos;re going .
I don &apos;t know .
Somehow , I just can &apos;t leave .
Why don &apos;t you get out of L.A. ?
Take a boat to China , take an airplane to <unk> ?
<unk> , death , shit .
Why do you stay ?
How the hell am I supposed to know ?
This is your damn city .
Snake - what is it ?
<unk> .
Come on .
How do we get out of here ?
Be careful of the bald cats .
They live in these buildings .
I just thought you wanted to get away .
I didn &apos;t know you wanted to go someplace .
This is a dead end .
You took us into a dead end !
Like hell I do .
You need help .
Don &apos;t follow me .
The <unk> General of Beverly Hills .
Oh no , it &apos;s the Doctor .
No screamin &apos; shit .
They live here , used to be like us .
But after too many <unk> <unk> , their muscles turned to jelly .
The only way they survive is to have body parts <unk> over and over again .
Snake , nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive .
What are they ?
A little bit .
But pretty soon I &apos;m gonna be dead .
So are you , Snake .
Are you crazy ?
Hi , Snake .
It &apos;s so great to meet you .
My name &apos;s <unk> .
I &apos;m a fan of yours .
Give me the prototype .
Where &apos;s the <unk> ... ?
Get ready , <unk> .
We &apos;re comin &apos; in .
I &apos;ve been doin &apos; that all my life .
Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is .
You &apos;re running out of time .
Well , I &apos;ll think it over .
<unk> is lost to me .
My daughter is gone .
I can see you &apos;re real concerned about your daughter .
Yeah ?
<unk> ?
I got ten million of them .
The President &apos;s promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars .
All of us ?
Yeah .
With me and Texas Mike O <unk> .
Hershe , you were in Cleveland ?
You owe me .
You left me holdin &apos; everything back there in Cleveland .
I &apos;m looking for somebody .
Hey , what &apos;s going down , Snake ?
<unk> itself it is only a piece of steel .
Its power comes from he who <unk> it .
For now there is no one .
Do as I have ordered !
My King , I couldn &apos;t do it .
Excalibur cannot be lost .
Other <unk> ... I saw nothing .
When you threw it in , what did you see ?
<unk> Excalibur .
Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it .
There is one thing left to do ... Excalibur ... And you must do it , <unk> .
Leave my wounds , I command you .
In the name of God , of St. Michael , and St. George , I make you a knight .
Rise , Sir ...
He heard Lady Guenevere &apos;s request and he said nothing .
That is all .
Is he coming ?
<unk> is the old wound , that has been opened .
I have always known it would be the <unk> to my death , for it has never healed .
Let my heart do its job , my King , and pump me empty ... You are that and much more .
You are its greatest knight , you are what is best in men .
Now we will be <unk> My salvation is to die a Knight of the <unk> <unk> .
Lancelot , I will save you ... Don &apos;t die .
It is deep ...
Hasn &apos;t Merlin <unk> your wound ?
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King &apos;s law .
They miss the <unk> .
I think we do too .
Only give me leave to ride out again , to do what I am most able to do , and happiest doing .
Your deeds set an example for all other knights .
For your gift , ask a gift of me .
I do .
Rise , Lancelot , come with me .
These men <unk> before God for their evil deeds .
Those who would not , met their fate at the end of my sword .
<unk> the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift .
We spared the lives of a few , so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur &apos;s knights ... Lancelot , how did you fare in the North ?
And a great heart it is .
Sir Lancelot , you will be my champion .
My <unk> is here , inside this metal skin .
And I would <unk> to you all that I still own : muscle , bone , blood and the heart that pumps it .
I gave up my castles and my lands !
But your life and lands are far from here .
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place .
You are still the best knight in <unk> .
You gained a hundred advantages over me .
It is I who must love you , for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson .
I , the best knight in the world , <unk> !
This is a great day , for my search is over .
I love you , my King .
Thanks to God , you are alive .
It is you , sir , who knows not the virtue of humility , as a true king must .
So be it , to the death .
Sir , your rage has <unk> you .
It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy , for a length of road you can ride around .
I <unk> only not to harm you , sir .
Fight me from your horse or on foot , but fight me .
Your <unk> <unk> me .
I will not .
<unk> .
I have the advantage .
I will not .
You must <unk> or prove your <unk> in the test of arms , under the eyes of God .
Not a boast , sir , but a curse .
Never have I met my match in <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> is a wild boast .
You lack a knight &apos;s humility .
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake , from across the sea .
I am the best knight in the whole of <unk> , and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword &apos;s service .
I am King , and this is Excalibur , sword of kings from the dawn of time .
Who are you , and why do you block the way ?
I <unk> the King himself .
His knights are in need of training .
Move aside .
This is the King &apos;s road , and the knights you joined arms against were his very own .
Good day to you , sir .
Lancelot ? ...
It is Lancelot !
He can be no other .
I dreamed of him too ... Merlin lives !
He lives in our dreams now , in that dark and <unk> place that is as strong and real as this more solid one .
He speaks to us from there .
Yes .
He spoke to me .
He said I would fight <unk> tomorrow .
I have never dreamed of Merlin before .
Merlin , will I live ... ?
... I was dreaming ... Ready my knights for battle ; they will ride with their King once more .
I have lived through others far too long !
Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt .
My knights have fought my causes .
<unk> carries my sins .
Now , at last , I will rule .
<unk> , you have returned !
... <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and all the <unk> to me .
Only the <unk> of their voices remains in this empty hall .
All I have left is the memory of their <unk> .
<unk> and memories .
I am a ghost of the King that once was ... ... <unk> is real , alive , my own flesh and blood .
I will see him , I must .
Don &apos;t recognize him .
You were trapped by <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
Is this a dream ?
Tell me , Merlin !
<unk> ... You brought me back .
Your love brought me back .
Back to where you are now , in the land of dreams ... Where have you been these many years ?
Is it true that <unk> But , I &apos;m here .
It is like a tree .
The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men .
Like <unk> those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree .
And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events .
But the earth is being torn apart , its <unk> stolen , and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer <unk> .
In fact , I nearly didn &apos;t make it in one piece .
What is this place , Merlin ?
I know .
I have heard <unk> and <unk> through the stones ... Quiet .
You &apos;ll wake the men , and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives .
I cannot .
I must not .
Here I must stay .
I must do it myself .
I must kill them both .
Lancelot and Guenevere .
Will you ride with me , Merlin ?
You betray the boy who drew the sword , the boy who saw the Dragon ... the Dragon who moves close by , <unk> and <unk> , restless , looking down , waiting for the King to be a king ... Me ?
I have lived by the oath of king and knight .
My powers <unk> , Arthur .
I resort to cheap tricks ...
Yes !
I enjoy every moment of my <unk> , I join in the making of it , so no one can betray me .
But you !
You betray yourself .
With all your powers , you are content to be <unk> , laughed at ... That is my destiny .
I have a destiny , too ...
I am alone and betrayed .
By my wife , by my beloved friend , by my knights .
And by you .
Perhaps most of all by you .
For you made me , you <unk> this <unk> life .
And like a child tired of a toy , you toss me aside , a <unk> <unk> <unk> after my sister ...
I didn &apos;t ask for poetry .
Which is it ?
What ?
The greatest ?
They blend together like the <unk> we mix to make a good sword .
A king should be afraid , always .
The enemy is everywhere .
Waiting in <unk> in the dark corridors of his castle , on the deer paths of his forest , or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest , in here .
Just yes ?
No mad <unk> , no riddles , nothing but a simple yes ?
That <unk> me .
What is it my child ?
Merlin , tell me .
Now that Guenevere is returned to me ... Never where you expect it , that &apos;s all I know .
Where <unk> evil , then , in my kingdom ?
Good and evil ; there is never one without the other .
Then answer me this .
For years peace has <unk> in the land .
<unk> grow in <unk> , there is no want .
Every one of my subjects <unk> his portion of happiness and justice , even those whose <unk> <unk> we must resolve here each day .
Tell me , Merlin : have we defeated evil , as it seems ?
At your service , sir .
... to ride out and meet them .
The knights of <unk> approach the camp .
It would be <unk> ...
The Lady of the Lake .
Take it .
Take it , quickly !
Excalibur !
Is it true ?
You know full well there is , and I go to meet it now .
Come witness my revenge .
Come now .
So much anger for such a little crime ?
Are you sure there is nothing else <unk> you ?
So you were stealing their honey .
They should have killed you .
I had to weave a little <unk> on the bees so I could get some honey , and I didn &apos;t feel up to using any more magic just yet .
Anyway , I was in less danger than you &apos;ll be in today .
I should have left you to <unk> for yourself .
You &apos;re not listening .
Your heart is not .
Love is deaf as well as blind .
Guenevere .
And a beloved friend who will betray you .
Who will it be ?
Put your mind to it , then .
There are <unk> as fair , and <unk> than Guenevere .
If I put my mind to it , I could see them now , many of them , <unk> for love of you , watching the hills for you coming from the high <unk> of their castles .
<unk> you their every favor .
Rich , <unk> if it is to be Guenevere , so be it .
I love her .
If she would be my queen , my dreams would be answered .
A king must marry , after all .
What &apos;s this , what &apos;s this ? !
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy .
The dragon !
There ...
The book without pages .
Open before you , all around us .
You can see it in bits and pieces , for if <unk> men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance , why , it would burn him to <unk> .
What book is that ?
In the great book .
Because you must !
You and only you .
Have you forgotten that it was you who <unk> Excalibur ?
It &apos;s just that I have no experience , and no men to speak of .
How can I-- I must find the means to save him , then .
I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help , but if it makes you so tired ... Well there .
You don &apos;t need me half as much as you think you do .
You already know what must not happen .
Yes , yes , I know that .
Everybody does .
Lord <unk> is my only ally among the <unk> and the great knights .
I can &apos;t lose him .
It is <unk> in the forest that ... ... <unk> &apos;s castle is under <unk> by Lot and <unk> .
<unk> me , Help me . &apos;
Help me get up .
Merlin , help me .
I need your help .
I don &apos;t know <unk> That &apos;s not why you came .
I want to thank you .
But not from your destiny .
You saved me from the arrow ... You are the son of King Uther , and the fair <unk> ... you are King Arthur .
Whose son am I ?
Speak of the devil ! ...
Who is Merlin ?
So be it .
I will <unk> a great force of knights , and I will return to fight for what is mine .
And I offer only this , Father .
To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit , as man and king .
I cannot offer you the land , only my love ...
Your mother told you that ?
The very <unk> that <unk> the side of Christ as he died on the cross .
And you are the great King ?
The <unk> have <unk> .
<unk> attack the <unk> .
<unk> don &apos;t grow .
There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land .
Only I am feared .
I will be king .
You may have lost Excalibur , but I have found my own weapon of power .
There .
I recognize you only as my son , no more .
I have come to claim what is mine , Father .
We fought and won battles , and now one man <unk> all my knights ?
I will go .
He is the <unk> and <unk> of knights .
I don &apos;t know .
Merlin brought you to me when you were <unk> born and charged me to raise you as my own .
At first , I did so because I feared Merlin , later because I loved you .
Who is , then ?
I did , Father .
I beg your <unk> .
You <unk> it , son ?
Sir ... <unk> needed a sword .
His was stolen .
I saw Excalibur , and ...
I took it .
Well hurry then , and get it .
I left it in the tent , sir .
I have kept it .
Forgive me , my wife , if you can .
I was not born to live a man &apos;s life , but to be the stuff of future memory .
The <unk> was a brief beginning , a fair time that cannot be forgotten ; and because it will not be forgotten , that fair time may come again .
Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was , and the dream of what could be .
I loved you much , as King , and sometimes as husband , but one cannot <unk> too long at the sun in the sky .
And if he cannot be found , no other knight will champion me , though you <unk> each and every one of them .
Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy ?
The laws , my laws , must <unk> everyone , high and low , or they are not laws at all .
Lancelot will come ... And you cannot love me ...
If I am your judge , I cannot be your champion .
When I act as your King , I cannot be your husband .
Why can &apos;t you be my champion ?
Not you , my husband ?
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf .
No .
I meant not to be angry with you , Sir <unk> .
In the <unk> that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil .
You <unk> repeat it .
Please , sir , have one of those apples that Lancelot loves , and in that gesture partake of its goodness .
Sir <unk> , answer the Queen .
Don &apos;t start a war on my wedding day !
I will ride with Sir <unk> .
Lancelot , rest here .
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers .
He must stay for the <unk> days of our wedding , and tell his deeds himself .
Quiet , or I &apos;ll sew up your mouth too .
No , I think it &apos;s better if you just stay here to heal .
At least a week .
Well , then , I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters , so you can avoid their castles .
I didn &apos;t know <unk> had a daughter .
--And <unk> in <unk> castles are waiting to be rescued ?
But I have to leave tomorrow .
The <unk> are thick with rebels , <unk> <unk> our <unk> ... --I &apos;m pretty good at <unk> .
I &apos;ve <unk> my father &apos;s wounds more than once .
It didn &apos;t hurt too much , did it ?
You and the land are one .
Drink from the <unk> .
You will be <unk> and the land with you .
I am wasting away and I cannot die .
And I cannot live .
Because you and the land are one .
I have waited long for you .
Once you almost saw , but fear blinded you .
Why am I served from the <unk> ?
You , my lord .
Who does it serve ?
We are to blame .
The King without his sword , the land without a king ...
He has given up .
Why didn &apos;t he kill us ?
There are things about <unk> Love demands it .
The law <unk> it .
I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend .
And , in <unk> my love to you , I cannot love any other woman .
To me ?
But why ?
Yes .
I would swear my love to you .
There is one .
And there is no maiden in the whole world who <unk> you ?
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest .
That is enough .
The <unk> secret is whether any of them has won your heart .
<unk> must wait , child .
These good ladies , for whom I <unk> once , will honor me with a meal .
I am <unk> to them now as I was when they begged my protection .
I have found you .
The Queen .
An apple .
Tomorrow .
Sir <unk> ... Twenty days ! ?
The world is that big ?
Listen , boy , it &apos;s more than twenty days from here .
I will run .
Very well .
Climb up .
You &apos;re a man ? !
... with metal skin !
Just a man .
A knight in the King &apos;s service .
--I am the fog and <unk> that rise up from the sea , escaping ... --I am the sea , which covers the desert forever under its weight .
I am the desert , where water <unk> I am the <unk> that <unk> the flames .
What &apos;s behind that beauty ?
A <unk> , <unk> snake .
You provoke me , Merlin .
Walls of shining <unk> , burning with red fire , <unk> of <unk> and jewels never seen by man ... What do you want ?
You must desire it for me to weave it .
I won &apos;t .
You would <unk> such power .
I have paid enough for you , and I will have you .
Merlin , the powers of <unk> , the true Name of the charms of Doing and <unk> .
Show me !
<unk> !
Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games ?
<unk> on you weakness of others .
That &apos;s your power , a petty evil .
Mine is great .
Great plans .
Impossible dreams .
<unk> <unk> ... You are truly magnificent !
People make you laugh ?
When Arthur built the castle , I carved out a place for myself , where I could laugh or sleep , and no one would bother me .
That I cannot .
You know what I want .
I want the secret of true magic , how to <unk> the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world .
The deepest secrets , the <unk> <unk> ...
I showed you all my <unk> tricks ... Shh ... yes , yes .
Sit with me , please ... <unk> .
A <unk> page !
No .
Yes , I am .
I am jealous .
I want to write poems about you with <unk> , make the sea sing your name ...
It &apos;s clear you are , and it <unk> me .
I &apos;m not jealous !
No , no , of course not .
You are young ... Can it truly be used for magic ?
Is that <unk> , Lord Merlin ?
You left your husband &apos;s side ?
You left your brother &apos;s wedding ?
They are not weapons , my friend , but truths .
You betrayed the Duke , stole his wife and took his castle , now no one trusts you .
Lot , <unk> , your <unk> will turn against you .
Give me the child , Uther , I will protect him .
Go back to your war tent .
You strike me with words as hard as steel .
Maybe not even that , Uther .
I thought once that you were the one to <unk> the land under one sword .
But it &apos;ll take another , a greater king ... To kill and be king , is that all ?
It &apos;s not for you , Uther , <unk> and home , wife and child .
You didn &apos;t ask !
The oath .
You didn &apos;t <unk> The child is mine , Uther .
I have come for him .
Now you must pay me .
Doing what I did for you , it wasn &apos;t easy , you know .
It takes it &apos;s toll .
It took nine moons to get back my strength .
Merlin !
Out of the sick sleep at last .
I swear it .
<unk> issues from your lust will be mine .
Swear it again .
I swear it .
By Excalibur and the <unk> <unk> riddles , Merlin .
I am your King .
I have walked my way since the beginning of time .
Sometimes I give , sometimes I take .
It is mine to know which , and when .
One land , one king !
That is my peace !
Behold the sword of power , Excalibur .
Before Uther , it belonged to <unk> , before <unk> , to Beowulf , before Beowulf to <unk> the Good , before <unk> to <unk> himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the <unk> .
Speak the words .
Just show the sword .
I should <unk> all and every one of them .
Merlin , what is this <unk> of tongues ?
Talk .
<unk> <unk> to each other ...
It &apos;s done .
A <unk> .
We meet at the river .
Shall we <unk> the writer ?
He &apos;s in Paris I believe .
Well why are they tearing the building down ?
Well what &apos;s wrong ?
C &apos;mon I can read for Christ sake .
Why it &apos;s perfectly plain , your the teacher at the college , you don &apos;t want the building torn down .
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn &apos;t make sense .
Ten maybe twelve years ago , in Africa .
The exorcism supposedly lasted for months .
I heard it damn near killed him .
I didn &apos;t know that .
It must be alright .
He &apos;s still running around digging up <unk> .
Besides , he &apos;s had experience .
Don &apos;t you think he &apos;s too old , though ?
How &apos;s his health ?
No , he &apos;s working on another book .
What &apos;s he doing there ?
<unk> ?
That &apos;s right Mike .
But he &apos;s finished and came back around three <unk> four months ago , He &apos;s in <unk> now .
<unk> ?
I had <unk> he was over in <unk> .
I think I read he was working on a dig around <unk> .
How about <unk> <unk> .
And what about the <unk> ?
Any ideas ?
Well , he does know the background .
I doubt there &apos;s any danger in just having him assist .
There should be a psychiatrist present , anyway .
Thank you your <unk> .
Let &apos;s see whose around .
In the meantime I &apos;ll call you as soon as I know .
I see , your <unk> .
It might be best to have a man with experience .
Maybe someone who &apos;s spent time in the foreign missions .
You &apos;d want to do the exorcism yourself ?
I don &apos;t know .
No , not really I suppose .
But I &apos;ve made a <unk> judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the <unk> .
You &apos;re convinced that it &apos;s genuine .
You &apos;re telling me that , I should take my daughter to a witch doctor ?
Is that it ?
It &apos;s a <unk> ritual in which <unk> or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit .
It &apos;s pretty much <unk> these days , except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of <unk> .
It has worked , in fact , although not for the reason they think , of course .
It was purely the force of suggestion .
The victim &apos;s belief in possession helped cause it ; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear .
You &apos;re sorry .
Christ , <unk> doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit ... And I don &apos;t care what you call it !
I &apos;m not putting her away !
Look , I &apos;m telling you again and you &apos;d better believe it , I &apos;m not about to put her in a goddamn asylum !
Quite frankly , we don &apos;t know much about it except that it &apos;s starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient &apos;s <unk> that his body &apos;s been <unk> by an alien <unk> ; a spirit if you will .
Sure you won &apos;t change your mind ?
I &apos;m gonna miss you .
What is it ?
Where do you want this ?
Of course I didn &apos;t .
This was under Regan &apos;s pillow .
Did you put it there ?
I can &apos;t believe it .
Oh Burke !
Poor Burke !
We have to start looking for a shrink .
What did the doctor say ?
Yeah , well I guess you should &apos;ve .
Well , when I went to get the <unk> I had him to stay with her and ... Oh , I should of known better .
What &apos;s Burke got to do with it ?
Didn &apos;t who tell me ?
What didn &apos;t he tell you ?
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self !
What are you kidding her window &apos;s wide open ... Why don &apos;t you let me ?
Oh circuit my ass , he doesn &apos;t give a shit !
Maybe the circuit is busy ?
Hello ?
Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil .
Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes .
Jesus Christ , can you believe this , he doesn &apos;t even call his daughter on her birthday for <unk> sake .
Just five or six people .
Your kidding me .
What is it a big party or something ?
Dinner at the White House .
And you got an invitation .
Oh great , anything else ?
Oh not to bad , kinda like the Walt <unk> version of the Ho Chi <unk> story , but other than that it was terrific .
Hi , how &apos;d your day go ?
You &apos;re a nice man .
I lied .
It &apos;s for me .
The <unk> is on the back , <unk> .
You know that film you made called Angel ?
<unk> that six times .
What &apos;s her name ?
Oh , she &apos;d love it .
Of course .
Have you got a pen ?
I hate to ask you this but ... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph ?
Couldn &apos;t hurt .
In the meantime ...
When she &apos;s well enough , I &apos;ll ask .
I know that .
I realize .
But if a certain British doctor never asked &quot; What &apos;s this fungus ? &quot;
we wouldn &apos;t today have <unk> .
Correct ?
Look , he wouldn &apos;t have any reason to be up there in the first place .
Incidentally , just a chance in a million , I know ; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night ?
Would you like some more coffee ?
Want to ask him ?
Oh , I see .
I really wouldn &apos;t know , you see Karl takes care of that .
<unk> maybe ?
A package ?
Not that I know of .
You were expecting a deliver y that day ?
No .
Not at all , Strange ... strange ... so <unk> .
The deceased comes to visit , stays only twenty minutes , and leaves all alone a very sick girl .
And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil , as you say , it &apos;s not likely he would fall from a window .
Besides that , a fall wouldn &apos;t do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand .
My hunch ?
My opinion ?
I believe he was killed by a very powerful man : point one .
And the <unk> of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned , would make it very <unk> - <unk> , not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter &apos;s window .
But no-one was here except your daughter .
So how could this be ?
It could be one way : if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned .
The servants , they have visitors ?
Watch out for <unk> .
A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for <unk> .
We still don &apos;t know .
May I ask ... ?
Yes , I &apos;m <unk> it is .
No , she was <unk> sedated .
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night ?
No thanks Karl .
Excuse me Madame ?
Will there be anything else ?
A man to see you .
Excuse me Miss ?
No .
It wasn &apos;t me .
I didn &apos;t .
Karl if you put this in Regan &apos;s room I want you to tell me , now did you ?
She is going to be well ?
Karl ?
Did you put this in Regan &apos;s bedroom ?
Bastard !
I will kill you .
No rats .
Thanks a lot that &apos;s terrific .
Very sorry , but you see , no rats !
Oh Karl , Jesus Christ Karl , don &apos;t do that .
There is nothing .
Well don &apos;t go now Karl the stores aren &apos;t open yet .
Yes , I go now .
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps .
I just heard them Karl .
No .
No rats .
All right then we &apos;ve got clean rats .
But it &apos;s clean ?
Uh huh .
&apos;Fraid so .
Good morning Karl .
Oh Karl , we &apos;ve got rats in the attic you better get some traps .
Good morning Madame .
Yes , I think so .
Is it coming out Willie ?
Fine thank you .
How are you today ?
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil .
I think it &apos;s time we started looking for a psychiatrist .
No .
I &apos;m building a new house , the old one &apos;s been sold .
I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while , after she finished school here .
Why d &apos;you ask ?
Are you planning to be home soon ?
LA , I mean .
Well of course I &apos;m sure .
I &apos;d tell you .
Christ , I don &apos;t even smoke grass .
Are you sure ?
No .
Of course not , nothing like that .
Do you keep any drugs in your house ?
Oh .
What are you talking about for Christ sake !
Did you see her or not ?
She &apos;s acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or ... We still think the <unk> lobe ... What was going on in there , how could she jump off the bed like that ?
She &apos;s <unk> sedated .
She &apos;ll probably sleep through tomorrow .
Don &apos;t be <unk> .
If it &apos;s a <unk> in a way she &apos;s fortunate .
All we have to do is remove the scar .
Hey do me a favour will ya &apos; .
Tell me something good .
The <unk> lobe is very common .
Could last for days , even weeks .
It isn &apos;t rare to find destructive or even criminal <unk> .
Look doc , I really don &apos;t understand how her whole personality could change .
<unk> , <unk> in the <unk> lobe .
It &apos;s a kind of <unk> disorder .
So , what causes this ?
Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed , it &apos;s her brain .
Oh no , that was no spasm .
I got on the bed , the whole bed was <unk> and rising off the floor and shaking .
The whole thing , with me on it !
The shaking of the bed , that &apos;s <unk> due to <unk> <unk> .
Well , It &apos;s a <unk> of a type of <unk> in the <unk> electrical activity of the brain .
In the case of your daughter in the <unk> lobe , up here in the <unk> part of the brain .
It &apos;s rare , but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a <unk> .
The best explanation is always the <unk> one .
Let &apos;s wait .
Let &apos;s wait and see .
In the meantime try not to worry .
Yeah , I guess .
Maybe not .
You don &apos;t think a <unk> ?
She used those words .
Look , I doubt that she even understood what she was saying .
She used those words ?
Well , <unk> , Mrs. MacNeil , she <unk> me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt .
Hey , come on , I &apos;m <unk> .
What &apos;d she say ?
I mean <unk> , Doctor .
Well , what , for example ?
I mean , give me a for instance !
Well , I &apos;d say her <unk> &apos;s rather <unk> .
You &apos;re kidding !
Like what ?
Well , she let loose quite a string while I was <unk> her , Mrs. MacNeil .
Wait a minute .
What are you talking about ?
Well , you see , that &apos;s quite similar to things like her <unk> <unk> Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use <unk> ?
Ya know , those things to get attention , like saying that her bed shakes and stuff .
And those lies she &apos;s been telling ?
Oh no .
I &apos;d wait and see what happens with the <unk> .
I think that &apos;s the answer .
Wait two or three weeks .
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist ?
Well , you mentioned her father ... the divorce .
Her condition isn &apos;t quite what it seems .
Nobody knows the cause of her <unk> <unk> in a child .
The <unk> <unk> to work to relieve the condition , but we really don &apos;t know how or why , frankly .
Your daughter &apos;s symptoms could be an <unk> to <unk> but that &apos;s out of my field .
<unk> ?
She &apos;s higher than a <unk> right now !
What is it ?
A <unk> ?
Now this is for <unk> .
Ten <unk> a day .
It affects concentration .
Why the math ?
A disorder of the nerves .
At least we think it is .
We don &apos;t know yet exactly how it works , but it &apos;s often seen in <unk> <unk> .
She shows all the symptoms : the <unk> ; the temper ; her performance in math .
Is she gonna die ?
Yes .
He &apos;s already here .
She killed Burke Dennings .
She pushed him out of the window .
She ... killed Burke Dennings .
Holy water &apos;s blessed .
And that doesn &apos;t help support a case for possession .
What &apos;s the difference ?
I told Regan that was holy water , I <unk> some on her and she <unk> very violently .
It &apos;s tap water .
Well I think you should .
Have you told him what &apos;s happening ?
Where &apos;s Regan &apos;s father ?
It &apos;s fine really , sit .
Are you sure ?
No it &apos;s alright I &apos;ll take it straight .
What do you drink ?
It &apos;s not important good night .
Not at all .
Why d &apos;you ask ?
No , is Regan aware of it ?
Yes I did , I &apos;m sorry .
Did you know my mother died recently ?
Did Regan know a priest was coming over ?
You show me Regan &apos;s double : same face , same voice , same everything .
I &apos;d know it wasn &apos;t Regan .
I &apos;d know in my gut and I &apos;m telling you that that thing upstairs isn &apos;t my daughter !
And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there &apos;s nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind !
You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn &apos;t do any good !
You tell me that !
There are no <unk> .
You probably know as much about possession than most priests .
Look your daughter doesn &apos;t say she &apos;s a demon , she says she &apos;s the devil himself and if you &apos;ve seen as many <unk> as I have , you &apos;d know it &apos;s like saying you &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
You ask me what I think is best for your daughter .
Six months , under <unk> in the best hospital you can find .
I thought you were supposed to be an expert .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ll have to look it up .
Like her speaking in a language that she &apos;s never known or studied .
I can &apos;t do it .
I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession .
Nothing you could do would make it any worse .
Thanks .
Look , I &apos;m only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good .
Oh , will you help her !
Just help her !
No , you don &apos;t understand .
Your <unk> Not a psychiatrist !
She needs a priest !
She &apos;s already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you , now you &apos;re gonna send me back to them !
Jesus Christ , won &apos;t somebody help her !
Yes I could , I could see her as a psychiatrist ... Could you see her ?
No I couldn &apos;t , I have to have church approval , and frankly , that &apos;s rarely given , - You could do it yourself ... Well before the church <unk> an exorcism , it <unk> an investigation to see if it &apos;s <unk> .
That takes time .
In the meantime ... To begin with it could make things worse .
Why , I don &apos;t understand ?
That &apos;s all the more reason to forget about exorcism .
Yeah well , it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed , and needs an <unk> .
Since we learned about mental illness , paranoia , <unk> .
All the things they taught me in Harvard .
Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the <unk> , I &apos;ve never met one priest who has <unk> an exorcism , not one .
Oh yeah , since when ?
Well it just doesn &apos;t happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil .
I didn &apos;t get you ?
Well , the first thing I &apos;d do is put them into a time <unk> and send them back to the <unk> century .
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind , how do you go about getting an exorcism ?
I beg your pardon ?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism ?
No I wouldn &apos;t .
But I &apos;d try to persuade him to turn himself in .
If he came to me for <unk> help , I &apos;d say no .
I mean , what if a person , let &apos;s say , was a criminal , like maybe a murderer or something , you know ?
If he came to you for help , would you have to turn him in ?
<unk> keep pretty tight <unk> then ?
He didn &apos;t mention her .
Didn &apos;t tell you of what she did ?
He didn &apos;t mention ?
No I didn &apos;t know you had one .
About my daughter ?
Did he tell you about my party ?
You &apos;re a friend of Father <unk> , right ?
Harvard , Bellevue , John <unk> .
It &apos;s the other way around .
The society sent me through <unk> school .
So , how &apos;d a shrink ever get to be a priest ?
Yeah , it would &apos;ve helped .
Have you gotta cigarette Father ?
That &apos;s okay .
I should &apos;ve told you I wouldn &apos;t be in uniform .
Oh , I &apos;m very sorry Father .
Hi .
I &apos;m Father Karras .
Please go away .
Honey this is Father <unk> .
Make it stop , it really hurts !
Mother !
Make it ...
So something please Doctor , Help her !
Mother please !
Oh please mother make it stop !
It &apos;s burning , it &apos;s burning please mother !
Honey it &apos;s to help you .
I don &apos;t want it .
Make it stop !
What &apos;s wrong ! !
I &apos;m scared ! ! !
Oh my God !
My bed was shaking , I can &apos;t get to sleep .
What are you doing here ?
God gets <unk> for us , <unk> .
He wants us back .
Why does God let us get tired ?
People get tired .
Cause Burke and I are just friends .
Okay , really .
How do you know ?
Well your thinking &apos;s not so good .
I don &apos;t know , I just thought .
Oh you did .
What did you hear ?
Well I heard differently .
Oh Regan I love your daddy .
I &apos;ll always love your daddy .
Burke just comes around here a lot because he &apos;s lonely , don &apos;t got nothin &apos; to do .
Do you not like him like daddy ?
Course I like him , I like pizzas to but I &apos;m not gonna marry one .
But you like him .
Where &apos;d you ever get an idea like that ?
Oh my god , you kidding , me marry Burke Dennings don &apos;t be silly , of course not .
Your not gonna marry him are you ?
Yeah I like him .
Don &apos;t you like him ?
Hey what &apos;s going on ?
What is this ?
You like him .
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday ?
Well you know it &apos;s okay .
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like .
I love you <unk> .
We &apos;ll have a good day yeah ?
Oh I love you .
Okay .
And tomorrow night , I &apos;ll take you to a movie , okay ?
Well what would you like to do ?
Got any ideas ?
I don &apos;t know What are we gonna do on your birthday , isn &apos;t that nice it &apos;s on a Sunday this year , what can we do ?
Oh you wouldn &apos;t talk , well I didn &apos;t have my make up man there .
I wouldn &apos;t talk .
It &apos;s not even a good picture .
Looks to mature .
Cause I like it .
Regan , why are you reading that ?
Well , maybe he &apos;s sleeping .
Captain Howdy , Do you think my mom &apos;s pretty ?
Captain Howdy ?
Captain Howdy that isn &apos;t very nice .
Here I &apos;ll show you .
Oh I bet he is .
Oh , Captain Howdy .... You know , I make the questions and he does the answers .
Who &apos;s Captain Howdy ?
No I do , Captain Howdy said no .
You really don &apos;t want me to play huh ?
Oh yeah , well let &apos;s both play .
No you don &apos;t .
I do it all the time .
Wait a minute you need two .
Here I &apos;ll show you .
You know how ?
You &apos;ve been playing with it ?
I found it .
Hey , where &apos;d this come from ?
Oh it &apos;s so funny .
You like it ?
Oh look at that .
We &apos;ll see Regan .
Now about those party invitations <unk>
When can I have one ?
We &apos;ll see when we get home okay .
Well , not while we &apos;re in Washington .
Think it was a <unk> .
It was grey .
Oh it was so beautiful , the guy let me ride it all around .
Really , what kind was it a <unk> or <unk> ?
Oh mom , you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse .
Wasn &apos;t it pretty ?
Well , me and Sharon played a game in the back yard , and we had a picnic down by the river .
What kind of stuff ?
What did you do today ?
Goodbye Father .
I call you .
She doesn &apos;t <unk> a thing .
Listen , I don &apos;t need any <unk> , but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club , with me as the head <unk> , for all eternity and they love me .
Yeah , don &apos;t stop .
Keep going .
Hi Chris .
Great party .
That &apos;s his office back of St. Mike &apos;s .
He &apos;s our psychiatric <unk> .
He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy , his mother passed away .
She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her .
What goes down there ?
I mean who &apos;s the priest I keep seeing , he &apos;s there all the time .
He has black hair and he &apos;s very intense looking ?
Over behind the church , you know where I mean over there , it &apos;s a red brick wing ?
What we missed in the <unk> and the <unk> could <unk> turn up there .
At the least , it would eliminate certain other possibilities .
A <unk> , I would think , pin down that <unk> .
It will involve another <unk> .
So what &apos;s next ?
There haven &apos;t been more than a hundred <unk> cases of <unk> called split personality , Mrs. MacNeil .
Now I know the temptation is to leap to <unk> , but any reasonable psychiatrist would <unk> the <unk> possibilities first .
So what &apos;s wrong with her ?
<unk> states can <unk> <unk> strength , accelerated motor performance .
For example , a <unk> women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck , runs out and <unk> the wheels half a foot up off the ground .
You know the story , same thing here .
Same principle , I mean .
Stealing is a sin .
No , I tell <unk> by reading the <unk> , now shut up and go to sleep .
Are you gonna steal my shoes now ?
Think you can sleep ?
There was nothing you could do .
<unk> down .
C &apos;mon .
Oh Christ !
I should of been there and I wasn &apos;t there , I should &apos;ve been there .
College president shouldn &apos;t drink .
<unk> to set a bad example , I figure I saved them from a big temptation .
I believe you .
I stole it .
Where &apos;d you get it then ?
That &apos;s an insult , I got a <unk> of <unk> .
Where &apos;d you get the money for the <unk> <unk> ?
The poor box ?
Another one .
Had your lunch ?
I &apos;ve seen it .
<unk> , Jackie <unk> , and in the role of Catherine <unk> , Lucille <unk> .
Who &apos;s in it ?
I get passes .
In fact I got a pass for The <unk> tomorrow night .
Would you like to go ?
Do you like films ?
Ah , that &apos;s good .
That &apos;s all that &apos;s important .
Back to business .
Back to work .
Bye now , Father .
She seemed fine .
How &apos;s the girl ?
You just missed them .
I came to say goodbye .
<unk> era <unk> .
I am no one !
I am no one !
He is a priest !

<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> !
<unk> <unk> I !
<unk> a <unk> eh !

Until she <unk> and lie stinking in the earth .
How long are you planning to stay in Regan ?
La <unk> de ma <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
You speak Latin ?
In time .
But <unk> <unk> , don &apos;t you agree ?
Do it again .
Did you do that ?
You and us .
You and Regan ?
It would bring us together .
But wouldn &apos;t that drive you out of Regan ?
You &apos;d like that ?
What an excellent day for an exorcism .
He broke the bread , gave it to his <unk> and said &quot; Take this , all of you and eat .
For this is my body . &quot;
When the supper had ended , he took the cup , again he gave you thanks and <unk> .
Gave the cup to his <unk> and said &quot; Take this , all of you will drink from it , this is the cup of blood , the blood of the new and ever <unk> <unk> and the mystery of faith &quot; .
If that &apos;s true , then you must know my mother &apos;s maiden name .
What is it ?
Your mother &apos;s in here with us Karras , would you like to leave a message ?
I &apos;ll see that she gets it .
Show me Regan and I &apos;ll loosen one of the straps .
In here .
With us .
That &apos;s much to vulgar a display of power Karras .
If you &apos;re the devil , why not make the straps disappear ?
And I &apos;m the Devil !
Now kindly <unk> these straps !
I see .
Well then let &apos;s introduce ourselves , I &apos;m Damien Karras .
I &apos;m not Regan .
I &apos;m <unk> you might hurt yourself Regan .
You might loosen the straps then .
Hello Regan .
I &apos;m a friend of your mother , I &apos;d like to help you .
Momma , I &apos;m all right , I &apos;m fine , really I am .
You are not happy .
Tell me what is the matter ?
<unk> , you worry for something ?
Momma I can take you somewhere to a place where you wouldn &apos;t be alone .
There &apos;d be people around , you know you won &apos;t have to sit here listening to the radio .
Now momma you have to stay off it , you can &apos;t keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest .
Is that too tight ?
Oh really , when ?
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me .
How &apos;s your leg ?
I &apos;m all right .
You &apos;re not my mother ! ! !
She &apos;ll go into coma .
Can you give her something ?
What is it ?
I think the point is to make us <unk> ... To see our <unk> as ... animal and ugly ... To <unk> the <unk> that God could love us .
Why this girl it makes no sense ?
... upon this your servant , Regan Teresa MacNeil .
<unk> of the human race ... And also with you .
The Lord be with you .
And let my cry come unto thee .
See the cross of the Lord .
Be gone you hostile power .
O <unk> hear my prayer .
... and the power to <unk> this cruel demon .
And let my cry come unto thee .
Father Karras ?
Father Karras ?
Damien ?
The <unk> please Damien !
O <unk> hear my <unk> .
... and to <unk> through your son .
Who lives and <unk> with you , in the <unk> of the holy spirit , God forever and ever .
Let us pray .
Holy Lord , almighty Father , everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who once and for all <unk> that fallen <unk> to the flames of hell .
Who sent your only <unk> son into the world to crush that <unk> lion .
And also with you .
The Lord be with you .
And let my cry come unto thee .
And the son of <unk> be <unk> to harm her .
Let the enemy have no power over her .
In the face of the enemy .
Be unto her o &apos; Lord a <unk> tower .
Who places her trust in thee , my God .
Save your servant As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be , world without end , <unk> .
Save me o &apos; God by thy name , by thy might defend my cause , proud men have <unk> up against me , men of violence seek my life , but God is my helper , the Lord <unk> my life and every need he has delivered to me , glory be to the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit .
But deliver us from the evil one .
<unk> be thy name .
Thy kingdom come , thy will be done , on earth as it is in heaven .
Give us this day , our daily bread , and forgive us our <unk> , as we forgive those who <unk> against us .
And lead us not into temptation .
There &apos;s only one .
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has <unk> .
So far , there seems to be three .
She &apos;s <unk> We may ask what is <unk> , but anything beyond that is dangerous .
He is a liar , the demon is a liar .
He will lie to <unk> us .
But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us .
The attack is psychological , Damien .
And powerful .
So don &apos;t listen , remember that , do not listen .
Do you want to hear the background of the case , first ?
I would like you to go quickly over to the <unk> Damien , and gather up a <unk> for myself , two <unk> , a purple stole , and some holy water , and your copy of The <unk> <unk> .
The Large one .
I believe we should begin .
I could have you <unk> , you know that ?
The <unk> .
Go pick on them .
Alright .
You know who I think really did it ?
Answer the question , Father <unk> .
One last time : Can you think of some priest who fits the bill ?
I &apos;ve seen it .
Who &apos;s in it ?
<unk> Reynolds , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> Marx .
You &apos;re happy ?
Who &apos;s in it ?
Yeah , I hate to go alone .
You know , I like to talk film ; discuss the <unk> .
D &apos;you wanna see a film with me ?
I got passes to The <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> .
That &apos;s to bad .
I get passes to the best shows in town .
Mrs. K though , she gets tired and never likes to go .
Hey , Father ?
You like movies ?
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession .
No , I mentioned it only in passing .
Is that a threat ?
Not to bother you with <unk> , but a psychiatrist in <unk> California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient .
No I probably wouldn &apos;t .
Ah , doctor &apos;s ethics .
If you knew you wouldn &apos;t tell , huh ?
I don &apos;t know anyone who fits the description .
Look , Father this is hard for you- please .
But for priests on the <unk> here , you &apos;re the psychiatrist ; you &apos;d know who was sick at the time , who wasn &apos;t .
I mean this kind of sickness .
You &apos;d know that .
Sick priest , is that it ?
Maybe somebody crazy , someone with a spite against the church , some unconscious rebellion , perhaps .
You think the killer and the <unk> are the same ?
Exactly .
So on the one hand we &apos;ve got a <unk> type of murder and a Black Mass style of <unk> in the church .
It &apos;s possible .
Possible however … Couldn &apos;t it of happened on the fall .
Let me tell you how Father , and please confidential .
Burke Dennings , good Father , was found at the bottom of those steps leading to &apos; M &apos; Street , with his head turned completely around .
<unk> backwards .
Yeah , a fall .
And Dennings , you read how he died ?
Maybe .
Some <unk> used in Black Mass .
Maybe .
I know .
I read it .
These <unk> &apos;s in the church … you think they have anything to do with <unk> ?
From the psychiatric end .
I once did a paper on it Papers .
Tell me , what do you know about the subject of <unk> ?
From the <unk> end , not the hunting .
Only what I read in the papers .
You &apos;ve seen him .
You &apos;re also familiar with how last week he died ?
I &apos;ve seen him .
You this director was doing a film here , Burke Dennings ?
Do people tell you look like Paul <unk> ?
Yeah , it &apos;s true .
You do look like a boxer .
John Garfield , in <unk> and Soul .
Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father ?
What &apos;s this about ?
William F. <unk> .
Homicide .
No we haven &apos;t met , but they said I could tell ; that you looked like a boxer .
Have we met ?

Just a minute .
Yes I am her brother , he &apos;s the son Are you a relative ?

We want to see Mrs. Karras .
If he talks to me , I think he &apos;ll leave you .
Do you want him to leave you ?
If I ask him to tell me , will you let him answer ?
I don &apos;t know .
Is it Captain Howdy ?
I don &apos;t know .
Who is it ?
Is there someone inside you ?
How old are you ?
Are you comfortable Regan ?
Give me the keys .
It &apos;s our goddamn car !
It &apos;s my goddamn car !
You &apos;re not going to drive !
Give me the keys !
You &apos;re not going to drive .
Give me the keys .
It wasn &apos;t half full out there tonight , Frankie .
I got six <unk> standing in back listening to baseball .
I gotta move the liquor .
To move the liquor , I gotta fill the tables .
It &apos;s a matter of economics .
Me , I love you .
I love both you guys , you know that .
You &apos;re class .
But people today .
They don &apos;t know class if it walks up and grabs &apos; em by the balls .
<unk> ?
Christ , Charlie , it &apos;s a Monday night .
You said so yourself .
So maybe it &apos;s time we took a vacation from each other .
Right , twelve years .
Couple times a month .
Look , Frankie .
You and Jack been playing here , a long time .
What &apos;re you saying , Charlie ?
It &apos;s all there .
Both nights .
I &apos;ve got the <unk> for two nights , Charlie .
You can &apos;t just -- We don &apos;t need you , Frankie .
What about tomorrow ?
Take it now .
Now ?
Why not tomorrow ?
After the show .
Little slow tonight .
Yeah , come on in .
You wanted to see me , Charlie ?
Just the same .
We have some <unk> .
Maybe next time .
Too bad .
You could use some sun .
Really .
Oh .
No .
<unk> <unk> .
Where are our kids ?
Has he got one of them in there ?
You believe this ?
The kid won &apos;t come out .
I &apos;m playing &apos; <unk> <unk> &apos; for him and the next thing I know he &apos;s locked himself in the bathroom .
There &apos;s nothing sharp in there , is there ?
You bring <unk> , Jack ?
Well , look at this .
I &apos;ll take her inside .
You too , little Frank .
Out of the pool .
Nothing &apos;s the matter .
Is it , sweetheart ?
The sooner we do this the better , Mr. Baker .
I think maybe I &apos;ll bring him back next week ... Don &apos;t worry , Mr. Baker .
We &apos;ll knock him out .
He won &apos;t feel a thing .
What do you do to him ?
Start him out on cottage cheese .
If you &apos;ve got him on <unk> , just <unk> it a few minutes .
Go down like pudding through a hot pipe .
How will he eat ?
<unk> unfortunately doesn &apos;t limit itself to the <unk> , Mr. Baker .
It <unk> into his chest .
Then the heart goes .
We wouldn &apos;t want that , would we ?
Isn &apos;t there something you can give him ?
A pill or something ?
Five &apos;s my guess .
Maybe more .
Won &apos;t know till I get in there .
Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning .
They gotta go .
<unk> .
That &apos;s not good .
Let &apos;s get him up here .
They &apos;re falling out .
What &apos;s wrong with them ?
What &apos;s our friend &apos;s problem ?
I don &apos;t see any ladies here .
Except maybe you .
You &apos;re a real tough guy when the ladies are around , aren &apos;t you , Ace ?
Go fuck yourself .
Come on , friend .
I can smell it on you .
Get yourself a cup of coffee .
You &apos;ll forget what you &apos;re angry about .
Get your hand off me .
What do you say we go for a walk , pal .
The fire .
The way we &apos;re going we &apos;ll be lucky to buy a <unk> of <unk> , let alone a new gym .
<unk> .
Tore it up against St. Anthony &apos;s .
Right before the accident .
What &apos;s wrong with the kid ?
My brother and I.
One each .
Two at a time ?
Oh .
What do you do ?
You the <unk> ?
Wait .
Watch .
Here comes Dad .
Oh , look at you two .
So skinny .
And those tiny suits ...
I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together .
Boy , old man Henderson didn &apos;t fool around when he gave a haircut , did he , Jack ?
In the attic .
Behind some of Dad &apos;s stuff .
Look , Jack can hardly reach the <unk> .
I thought these were lost .
Where did you find ...
<unk> these two characters ?
Oh my God ... Catholics .
What do you expect ?
Oh , well , what &apos;s in a name , right ?
Let &apos;s go inside and have a look at that cake .
Uh ... yeah , well , you know , Ma , John Kennedy went by Jack .
Yes , yes .
It &apos;s just that John is so much nicer .
Jack sounds so ... crude .
When I was a little girl , we had a pig on the farm named Jack .
I guess I just can &apos;t help making the <unk> .
Twenty years , Ma ...
I thought maybe held gotten over that .
Uh , Ma , you know , no one calls him that anymore .
Jack .
He goes by Jack .
A little <unk> , but just as <unk> .
How &apos;s the birthday girl ?
Well , if it isn &apos;t the fabulous Baker Boys !
<unk> &apos; em , Willie .
The <unk> downtown , <unk> .
Thanks .
What &apos;s the gig ?
Wednesday next .
Frank looks across the room at Jack .
When they coming in ?
What happened to the two <unk> , Willie ?
I told Halloran we didn &apos;t do <unk> , but he said : She asked for it .
Christ , that &apos;s right .
How could I forget .
What a nightmare .
<unk> &apos;s .
Sweet sixteen .
Right .
It was someone &apos;s birthday .
Halloran ?
Five years ago .
November .
Jesus , when was the last time we played the <unk> ?
Yeah .
Larry <unk> .
<unk> .
Couple others .
Donna said even Lloyd called the other day .
Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow <unk> , huh ?
I can keep the beat .
I mean , you can play .
You &apos;re okay .
Yeah , I know .
Me , too .
You know , that night , I ...
It just all came up .
Oh .
Fine .
It was nothing .
Couple sore knuckles .
Nothing .
How &apos;re your hands ?
This &apos;ll kill &apos; em .
Looks like these got a few years on them .
I &apos;ll take the <unk> .
Hey , what do you know .
Looks like we can have that drink after all .
What &apos;s your pleasure ?
We got the downtown <unk> .
We got the <unk> on Route 41 .
And ... the <unk> .
Oh , yeah , right .
I forgot .
No , it &apos;s not that .
I ... can &apos;t drink from the bottle .
I ... gag .
<unk> it on the way over .
Clean as a <unk> .
There &apos;s not going to be a <unk> .
I figured with the kids and all ...
I set it for Wednesday .
The ceremony .
They &apos;re doing the stone today .
It &apos;s okay ?
Wednesday ?
Oh .
Yeah .
It was all worked out before , you know .
She and Dad had taken care of it .
Is everything done ?
The arrangements , I mean .
Uh , we already <unk> some things .
I figured you &apos;d want to go through Dad &apos;s stuff .
It &apos;s in there .
If you want to get started .
Oh ...
I was just hoping for something to drink .
But it seems the old lady was dry .
Not even a bottle of cooking <unk> .
What &apos;re you doing ?
I didn &apos;t hear you come in .
Who &apos;s weak now , big brother ?
No , fuck you .
And fuck him too .
Fuck the <unk> you .
That &apos;s right .
I wasn &apos;t there .
I don &apos;t have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy .
You weren &apos;t there .
No , let &apos;s stay on it .
I &apos;m sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god .
For Christ sake , Jack , he died doing a stupid bullshit <unk> .
He left a wife and two sons .
He wasn &apos;t a hero .
He was a fool .
Stay off it .
<unk> ?
Who the hell are you to talk about <unk> ?
What &apos;s happening to you , Frank ?
You been kissing ass so long you &apos;re starting to like it ?
You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight .
We were always small time , but we were never clowns , Frank .
What &apos;s happened to your <unk> ?
It wasn &apos;t professional , Jack .
It was a stunt .
A <unk> stunt .
I &apos;m sorry .
I should &apos;ve checked it out .
I screwed up .
But that doesn &apos;t mean you walk out in the middle of a gig .
<unk> , Frank .
You had us playing for <unk> .
Look .
I didn &apos;t know when we were going to be on until yesterday .
What was I supposed to do ?
I had the <unk> anyway .
<unk> you ?
A fucking moron ?
It &apos;s three o &apos;clock in the morning , Frank .
Who &apos;s watching ?
Your wife ?
Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank &apos;s birthday party .
What do you think ?
Shut up , Frank .
Jack , you &apos;re on television .
We &apos;re playing for a goddamn <unk> !
Are you kidding me ?
Are you fucking kidding me ?
We &apos;re on after <unk> .
What &apos;s wrong ?
A channel .
It &apos;s just a little further down the dial , that &apos;s all .
Look , it &apos;s publicity .
<unk> &apos;s publicity .
Right ?
<unk> ?
What &apos;s <unk> ?
What channels it on ?
It &apos;s a disease , Jack .
We &apos;re against it .
It &apos;s not a moral decision .
You don &apos;t know ?
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t know .
Some disease .
What &apos;s it for ?
I told you , Jack .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
No one gets a cent .
Nothing .
We get nothing .
We &apos;re not getting paid then .
You know , my brother and I have been playing together , gosh , I don &apos;t know .
Jack ?
Better give her pneumonia .
You want to know how much I got tied up in <unk> with Willie ?
We &apos;re in for three weeks solid , Jack .
Just until we find another girl .
What &apos;re you doing ?
I play two hundred nights a year with you , Frank .
How much more reasonable you expect me to be ?
Be reasonable , Jack .
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance .
What do you mean ?
I can &apos;t make the tenth .
The tenth &apos;s out .
That takes care of this week .
The tenth we got the Sheraton , the <unk> we &apos;re at the <unk> .
Maybe so .
You ever go back there ?
Where it happened .
You &apos;re making things up , Frank .
I could &apos;ve .
But he didn &apos;t want me to .
You could &apos;ve come .
Yeah , but he told you things .
He never told me anything .
Even though I was the oldest .
It was always you two , running off , doing things together .
It was just a can of beer , Frank .
It was like you &apos;d passed some test , you know ?
He was just having fun .
Yeah , and you drank yours like it was orange juice .
He loved that about you .
You always threw up .
I always think of him on New Year &apos;s .
How he used to pour us each half a can of beer .
Remember ?
God , the old man would &apos;ve loved this view , wouldn &apos;t he ?
I told you .
It &apos;s a useless talent .
Not for me .
I still have to look at the music sometimes , you know that ?
Otherwise , I forget .
I just forget .
But you .
You never forget .
Ever .
So how come you couldn &apos;t remember Ma &apos;s birthday ?
They were simple songs .
<unk> me crazy when we were kids .
The way you never looked at the music .
Miss Simpson would just play it and ... A useless talent .
Right .
It &apos;s incredible how you do that .
Remember things .
Right .
The Royal .
When &apos;s the last time we were there ?
A gift .
<unk> of our <unk> hotel manager , Mr. Daniels .
We , dear brother , are a fucking smash .
Yup .
They want us back .
Easter .
It seems they have this egg hunt every year .
Only not for kids .
<unk> .
They stuff these plastic eggs with <unk> and little certificates for free <unk> <unk> and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front <unk> .
Then afterwards , they have a dance .
An egg dance .
Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open .
It &apos;s our job to separate the <unk> from the whites .
<unk> business .
No , you &apos;re wrong .
It &apos;s just beginning .
Come on , have a drink .
Show your big brother how it &apos;s done .
The party &apos;s over .
<unk> .
Join me ?
What &apos;re you doing down here ?
You &apos;re a heavy <unk> , Frank .
You &apos;ve <unk> a heavy <unk> .
Unlike me .
How come I didn &apos;t hear anything ?
He had to come quickly .
It was a big leak .
He was wearing a suit .
We had a leak in the bathroom .
He fixed it .
What are you talking about ?
He &apos;s with the hotel .
I called him .
You saw wrong .
We were just having a little discussion about morality .
What &apos;re you trying to do ?
Wake up the whole goddamn hotel ?
<unk> there &apos;s someone who looks like you , walking around the street somewhere .
Wonder if I saw him I &apos;d think it was you ?
<unk> .
I came up with the idea on the road .
See , every morning the <unk> drop one of these cards in each room .
The guest <unk> out the card , leaves it at the front desk , and that night we play it .
Daniels went crazy for the idea .
And that &apos;s not all .
Last night , after the nine o &apos;clock , he <unk> me , right , and starts asking about our <unk> .
Like he wants to line something up .
I think he &apos;s got a hard-on for Susie .
What the hell are these ?
Yeah , well , she &apos;s our girl now .
I think we better keep an eye on her .
There &apos;s trouble there .
Hey , listen to this .
<unk> and <unk> Lane .
<unk> seventy-five years .
You believe that ?
She &apos;s a big girl .
Just wonder what she &apos;s up to .
I never see her .
Makes me nervous .
You haven &apos;t seen Susie , have you ?
Time flies , huh ?
Two hours ago !
They stopped serving two hours ago .
<unk> .
Once I finish this <unk> I &apos;m gonna get breakfast .
You see what &apos;s on the <unk> ?
How long you been at it ?
How &apos;s it coming ?
Yes , really .
I don &apos;t want you to be unhappy , Jack .
If you say it &apos;s out of tune , it &apos;s out of tune .
What &apos;s it look like I &apos;m doing ?
I &apos;m <unk> a goddamn piano .
What the hell are you doing ?
It won &apos;t happen again .
Scout &apos;s honor .
How dare you say you love me .
I &apos;m sorry , Frank .
All that talk about family .
I just got emotional .
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
I love you .
I just wanted to say it .
Right .
I love you , Frank .
Thank you , thank you .
You know , Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday , but already the people here at the King Corporation &apos;s <unk> <unk> have made us feel , well , a part of the family .
And it &apos;s their hope that , before you leave , everyone of you will feel a part of that family also .
So , if <unk> next few days , we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don &apos;t be a stranger .
Stop .
Say hello .
<unk> yourself .
Because here , there are no strangers , only friends .
And family .
Right , Jack ?
Well , then stuff cotton in your ears , because come six o &apos;clock we &apos;re gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on .
Understand , little brother ?
Because I can hear it .
What matters to me is we &apos;ve got the six <unk> nights we &apos;ve had in ten years .
So &apos; Tie a Yellow <unk> &apos; sounds a little flat .
So what ?
Nobody &apos;s gonna hear it , Jack .
Nobody .
So why should you care ?
Doesn &apos;t it matter to you ?
No !
I never hear it !
Maybe .
Sometimes .
I don &apos;t know .
But I won &apos;t let it bother me .
Christ , can &apos;t you hear it ?
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
So the piano &apos;s a little out of tune .
So what ?
No , that &apos;s your problem , Frank .
You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking <unk> .
Jack ... Jack ... You &apos;re acting like a kid .
Why don &apos;t we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he &apos;s trying to say .
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say , Jack , is -- <unk> ?
I don &apos;t think I know what you mean .
I don &apos;t know .
I mean , I always did it as a kid .
I figured it was no big deal .
Is it ?
A big deal ?
Why would I mind ?
Yeah .
You mind ?
So you &apos;re gonna leave it on .
Every night .
For a week .
We &apos;re gonna be here a week ?
You leaving that on ?
But if it doesn &apos;t work out , let me know .
I &apos;m , flexible .
I just figure things &apos;ll go <unk> , you know , if we have it all worked out from the beginning .
We might as well do the towels the same way .
No , you take the right .
Unless you want the right .
I figure that way we won &apos;t get confused .
I &apos;m putting my stuff on the right , okay ?
Good idea .
To Peggy Lee .
Have some more wine , Frank .
Not true .
Besides , Jack &apos;s the romantic .
A few bars !
Frank asked if she &apos;d sit in for a song , she said yes , and we did a few bars .
<unk> .
White <unk> .
Beautiful .
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in .
It was April .
April <unk> .
That one I remember .
She was staying at the Grand downtown ... Come on , Jack .
It &apos;s not like it &apos;s the first time we &apos;ve <unk> together .
It &apos;ll be like when we were kids .
Relax .
Enjoy the view .
I thought we all had separate rooms .
We do .
She &apos;s got hers , we &apos;ve got ours .
Hey .
<unk> and <unk> .
I thought we had separate rooms .
Two years ago .
March .
When &apos;s the last time we played a wedding , Jack ?
All right , but if you change your mind , let me know .
I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway .
Thanks , but I &apos;ve got plans .
You want to come out to the house tomorrow ?
The way the <unk> been <unk> up , Donna &apos;s decided to really lay it on .
<unk> , <unk> , the whole bit .
<unk> &apos;s so full of food you can hardly move .
We could use another appetite .
Well , the line &apos;s growing weaker , little brother .
Lucky for us there aren &apos;t any <unk> left to <unk> .
Yeah , well , what can I say ?
Dad must &apos;ve had forty pounds on me .
Jesus , you remember him being this big ?
So what do you think ?
Just a lucky guess .
You recognized me .
Okay I &apos;ll see you tomorrow night then .
You all right ?
You wanna get a drink ?
Yeah ... Well , I gotta go .
Something , huh ?
All those <unk> .
I &apos;ll take my chances .
Better take care of your fingers , little brother .
Buy yourself a case of <unk> and you won &apos;t be able to play &apos; <unk> . &apos;
That &apos;s it except for the first .
We got the Sheraton , the Ambassador , or the Holiday Inn on <unk> .
All <unk> turns .
Make it collect .
That &apos;s what I figure .
Probably have us in a <unk> playing to the <unk> .
Sounds like a <unk> agent looking to book an easy fee .
And it &apos;s especially nice to be among friends tonight , because , well , tonight &apos;s a very special night for my brother and I.
This evening we &apos;ve asked a young lady to join us , a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all .
She &apos;s making her <unk> here this evening and , as far as I &apos;m concerned , she couldn &apos;t be doing it in a better place .
Because there &apos;s one place that &apos;s always been for us a very special place , and that place is this place , the Ambassador <unk> .
Ladies and gentlemen , please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song , Miss Susie Diamond .
Jack , for crying out loud .
Your <unk> &apos;s showing .
Ah , here we go .
How about these ?
Here , how &apos;s this ?
I just wish she &apos;d get here , that &apos;s all .
You &apos;re a fucking alarm clock .
All right , all right .
I &apos;m a little tense .
I told you I was gonna hit you .
You hit me .
I &apos;ll hit you , Frank .
I swear .
It &apos;s not gonna hurt you .
Get out of here !
Come on , stand still .
Get out of here .
Yeah , well , Your &apos;s isn &apos;t .
Let me run a comb though it .
Just like the day of the auditions , right ?
Jesus .
How &apos;s my hair ?
She &apos;ll get here .
I told everyone <unk> .
Didn &apos;t I ?
<unk> .
Where the hell is she ?
I &apos;ll drop the <unk> .
I suppose we can bring it down a little .
I didn &apos;t get her number .
What &apos;s the matter ?
Okay , okay .
I &apos;ll call the girl .
How many other silent partners are there , Frank ?
Donna ?
Little Cindy ?
Hell , let &apos;s give Eddie a vote .
Ma ?
Ma ?
Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador ?
Oh , that &apos;s right , she was on <unk> .
How could I forget .
I was just thinking what Ma would think .
You &apos;re getting cold feet about this .
I don &apos;t know ... She had gum on her lip , for Christ sake .
I don &apos;t think she &apos;s right for the act .
What &apos;s there to talk about ?
She can sing .
That puts her at the head of the class .
That makes her the only one in the class .
I just thought we should talk about it .
Between ourselves .
What are you , crazy ?
All right .
What &apos;s your name ?
Let &apos;s get it over with .
I just don &apos;t understand .
You would think someone ... anyone ...
It was a somewhat extraordinary day .
Thirty-seven girls .
And not one who can carry a tune .
That must be <unk> impossible .
It never was .
Two <unk> isn &apos;t enough anymore , Jack .
You , Frank .
All these years you been telling me we &apos;re different .
We got <unk> , Jack .
No one can touch us .
I thought maybe twenty percent .
Look , with the additional <unk> we &apos;ll come out ahead .
The big hotels , they want a pretty girl with a big voice .
We have to stay competitive , Jack .
I &apos;m grateful , Frank .
How much ?
For the singer .
I &apos;ve tried to do well by you , Jack .
By both of us .
Frank .
Fuck it .
Okay ?
If you &apos;d like to assume more of the financial responsibilities , I &apos;d be glad -- I &apos;m not unhappy .
If you &apos;re unhappy with the arrangement -- That &apos;s what we agreed .
We agreed that if I took care of the business ; I &apos;d be entitled to the extra .
Isn &apos;t that what we agreed ?
It &apos;s more like <unk> , wouldn &apos;t you say ?
It &apos;s just an idea .
I want your opinion .
I mean , we go halfway on everything , right ?
Sure , why not .
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes .
I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer .
Look , can we forget last night ?
We gotta talk .
Hey , you weren &apos;t there .
Right ?
Yeah , and what put him up there ?
A <unk> of wind killed him .
That how you see it ?
Hey pal , I got a mortgage , all right ?
I got two kids .
I got a wife .
Besides , he made the deal .
There &apos;s no shame in it .
What was it like ?
It wasn &apos;t like that .
Bullshit .
Fifteen years , Frank .
No one paid us off .
I told you .
Something came up .
Some political dinner or something .
The hell you don &apos;t .
I don &apos;t know what you mean .
Charlie paid you off last night , didn &apos;t he ?
You ask me out here to sell me your house , Frank ?
Yeah ... we &apos;re gonna paint in the spring .
After the rains .
Look good as new .
The trees .
The flowers .
Nice .
Honey , it &apos;s only Uncle Jack .
You remember Uncle Jack .
Your <unk> doesn &apos;t work .
So you &apos;ll come out , right ?
Something came up .
Don &apos;t worry , Charlie stayed true .
Both nights .
I &apos;ll give you your share tomorrow .
At the house .
What &apos;re you talking about ?
We don &apos;t get a gig .
So talk to me tomorrow .
After the gig .
It &apos;s not family .
It &apos;s business .
I &apos;ve had enough family for one month , Frank .
Yeah .
Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow , will ya ?
Nothing .
Everything &apos;s great .
Terrific .
What &apos;s with Charlie ?
Her hands .
Like that .
What do you mean ?
I made her nervous .
So what &apos;d we get her ?
Christ , Jack , it &apos;s her birthday .
You &apos;re thirteen months older than me , Frank .
That might &apos;ve meant something in the <unk> <unk> , but it don &apos;t cut too deep anymore .
Your older brother .
You gotta go .
I don &apos;t gotta go .
This time you gotta go .
No , you gotta go &apos; cause if you don &apos;t get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty .
I won &apos;t feel guilty , so I don &apos;t gotta go .
We gotta go , Jack .
So do I.
No , I mean it .
By the way , we gotta go see Ma tomorrow .
It &apos;s more than that .
It &apos;s only a ring .
Not a collar .
Funny .
<unk> a bell ?
Uh-uh .
How about you ?
You seeing anyone ?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador ?
I &apos;m not seeing anyone .
In particular .
Because I &apos;m your brother .
Because I care about you .
Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours .
Why the interest ?
Seeing anyone in particular ?
Only on odd days .
Really .
You sleeping ?
You look awful .
Trust me , you &apos;re not missing anything .
You know , I think it &apos;s been five years since I saw you eat anything .
That &apos;s the God &apos;s truth .
Try the black <unk> .
What do you think ?
<unk> white .
Nice .
What d &apos;ya got ?
What d &apos;you say , Willie ?
<unk> her up ?
<unk> black .
<unk> .
What d &apos;ya got ? , Look , I just thought if you came out you might see what you &apos;re missing .
You got weird kids , Frank .
She didn &apos;t know what she was doing .
You &apos;re too sensitive .
She threw a goddamn radio into the <unk> .
How do you explain that ?
It was no fucking accident , Frank .
The little one ...
It was an accident .
They tried to <unk> me , Frank .
They don &apos;t .
They &apos;re always asking about you .
Only by relation .
Besides , they hate me , too .
You &apos;re their uncle .
I hate your kids , Frank .
Listen ... why don &apos;t you come out to the house this weekend .
Say hello to the kids .
They &apos;ve grown .
Maybe Thursday .
I hear the <unk> at the Sheraton &apos;s got <unk> .
So we on tomorrow night ?
Fuck him .
Great .
Terrific .
Fuck him .
This isn &apos;t the <unk> <unk> Inn on Route <unk> , Jack .
You mind telling me what that was about in there ?
Was that planned ?
Or were you just bored and decided to get creative ?
Count the fucking money , Frank .
Like an angel .
I mean it , Jack .
<unk> .
Who &apos;s gonna make trouble ?
Hey , <unk> !
Don &apos;t make trouble , all right ?
Of course , back then , things were a little different .
I was eight , Jack was seven , just about the only song we knew was &apos; My <unk> <unk> Over the Ocean &apos; , and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat , <unk> .
We must have <unk> three lives off that cat , eh , Jack ?
That &apos;s a lot of water under the bridge , eh , Jack ?
<unk> years , Frank .
You know , my brother and I have been playing together , gosh , I don &apos;t know .
How long has it been , Jack ?
No one &apos;s gonna be looking at my hair .
Come on , we &apos;re on .
You look like you just crawled out of bed .
What &apos;s wrong with it ?
Christ , will you look at your hair ?
Frank .
I &apos;m here .
I always get here .
Don &apos;t sweat it .
You want me to show up late a few nights ?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment , Jack .
What &apos;s the point ?
That &apos;s not the point .
Am I late ?
How we ... ?
What , are you kidding me ?
How we doing ?
Great .
Terrific .
Glad you could make it .
Your limo &apos;s ready , Ma .
A cab ?
Ma , come on .
My car &apos;s just a half block down .
You wait here .
Just call me a cab .
No , we &apos;re not .
Jack ?
No , no .
You boys are tired .
I guess you &apos;re , right .
Well , what do you say we get a little midnight <unk> ?
Theo &apos;s should still be open .
A few empty tables .
It &apos;s <unk> .
Besides , <unk> <unk> couldn &apos;t fill this place on a Wednesday night .
The audience was a little off tonight .
<unk> .
Both of you .
So what &apos;d you think ?
<unk> of the moment .
You should &apos;ve told us you were coming , Ma .
We would &apos;ve come and got you .
What am I gonna do ?
Put a record player out there ?
Bad , Frankie .
Bad .
Look , Nick .
You want us to pack up , we &apos;ll pack up .
You got no right <unk> this on me , Frankie .
It &apos;s <unk> .
So she &apos;s got a few <unk> .
Sick ?
How sick ?
Well ... thanks .
Bye .
Yes , it is .
Oh , sorry .
I get so caught up in it sometimes .
It &apos;s scary .
Really ?
Isn &apos;t that a coincidence .
Uh ... he knows it .
It &apos;s one of Jack &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> Man . &apos;
Is that all right ?
Uh-huh .
Well , Miss <unk> , what is it you &apos;d like to do for us ?
And if she asks what it &apos;s about , don &apos;t tell her .
She &apos;s opposed to my career .
But if you call my house and my mother answers , ask for <unk> .
If you ask for Monica , she &apos;ll think you have the wrong number and hang up .
Well , that &apos;s fine -- No romance , right ?
That &apos;s why I came up with Monica .
It &apos;s what I prefer .
<unk> .
Monica .
The whole thing .
It &apos;s my stage name .
My real name &apos;s <unk> .
Actually , that &apos;s my stage name .
Uh ... Frank Baker .
This is my brother .
I &apos;m sorry to interrupt , but when I saw you sitting here , I just had to come over .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
You have any previous entertainment experience , Miss Diamond ?
Susie .
Susie Diamond .
What &apos;s that mean ?
<unk> .
You find a girl ?
So run a little longer .
We ran long .
So if I &apos;m so &apos; late how come you &apos;re still here ?
You &apos;re an hour and a half late .
I don &apos;t believe it .
I come all the way down down here , break a heel , and you &apos;re not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I &apos;m a few minutes late .
How should I take it ?
Don &apos;t take it personally .
Just like that , huh ?
You &apos;re not even gonna give me a chance ?
Look , miss .
We &apos;re tired , you have gum on your lip , and we &apos;re going home .
This is show business ?
<unk> .
First rule of show business .
My watch is broken , too .
You &apos;re an hour and a half late .
What about me ?
What do you mean ?
This is where the auditions were .
This where the auditions are ?
And two more times tomorrow night , and two more times the next night , and the next night and the next night and the next night .
Frank , I can &apos;t sing that fucking song anymore !
Susie .
It &apos;s one more show .
One more time .
That &apos;s all .
I &apos;m gonna throw up , Frank .
I mean it .
Let &apos;s drop it for the ten o &apos;clock , okay ?
What &apos;re you talking about ?
They love it .
That song .
I can &apos;t sing it anymore .
I &apos;m gonna get sick .
I can &apos;t sing it anymore .
How about you ?
Got a Bar <unk> this weekend ?
I guess I ...
If I jumped to ...
I just saw a man walk out of your room !
No .
You listen .
I had my doubts about you from the beginning <unk> ?
Hey listen , pal ...
In case you &apos;ve forgotten , we &apos;re being paid to be here .
So it might be nice if you <unk> yourself with a certain amount of decency .
I just saw a man walk out of your room .
You want to tell me what the hell &apos;s going on ?
Forget your tie , handsome ... Frank !
Someone needs to grow up .
I won &apos;t take it , Jack .
What &apos;s with you guys ?
Well then ... shall we ?
Oh .
Yeah .
I gotta bunch of them .
Got another song for us ?
Uh , well , I love you , too , Jack .
So .
Susie .
How &apos; bout it .
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle .
What &apos;s with you two ?
He &apos;s just afraid to show it .
Aren &apos;t you , little brother ?
I don &apos;t believe it .
You &apos;re a romantic , Frank .
What do you say we send a bottle over ?
They must &apos;ve bought the same map we did .
Hey , will you look at that ?
No .
We got a picture , though .
One of the <unk> had a camera .
God , we were just kids .
That was something , wasn &apos;t it ?
Wow .
You ever see her again ?
People . &apos;
You think <unk> , right ?
Hot that night .
<unk> .
Through the whole audience .
I could hardly play .
What &apos;d she sing ?
As Charlie <unk> is my witness .
You &apos;re kidding me .
Hey , we &apos;re connected .
It &apos;s paradise .
That &apos;s what it is .
<unk> .
Smells like tuna number two to me .
Of course it smells like fish .
We &apos;re on the ocean .
What &apos;d you expect , <unk> number five ?
Smells like fish .
And how about this air ?
I &apos;m telling you , a few days in this place &apos;ll put five years on your life .
I told you , he &apos;s got the gift .
Same with music .
<unk> it once and he &apos;s got it .
I don &apos;t believe it .
<unk> <unk> Inn .
He &apos;s always right .
Go ahead .
Pick a virgin .
First times .
Hey , look at this .
Jesus , you fellas &apos;ve made a lot of noise .
What &apos;s with the stars ?
You play all these places ?
Sorry .
It only plays <unk> .
Maybe we should just listen to the radio .
You two could play <unk> .
For the kids .
Merry Christmas , you two .
Don &apos;t forget .
We leave the <unk> .
Well , well .
Ho , ho , ho .
You <unk> at <unk> &apos;s , Frank ?
So find a dime .
Let &apos;s get out of here .
Uh , well ... we flipped a coin .
Maybe .
I &apos;ll call him .
Maybe it &apos;s legit .
By the way , I got a <unk> yesterday from some guy looking for New Year &apos;s action .
<unk> , <unk> .
We take the <unk> , right ?
Simple .
I guess it &apos;s , the Plaza then .
That brings us to the twenty-seventh .
We got the <unk> for three or the Park downtown for two .
The Carlton &apos;s a dump .
No cover .
No minimum .
And they water their drinks .
It &apos;s strictly for the <unk> brush crowd .
Jack , you with us ?
We do not take tips .
I &apos;ll apply this to the cost of the dress .
I was gonna split it with you guys .
We are not a <unk> act .
We do not take tips from dirty old men .
Give me that .
For Christ sake , I said it , I didn &apos;t do it .
Besides , I don &apos;t think they were too offended , do you ?
Did you hear it ?
I said I was sorry .
Fucking .
She says fucking in front of an entire room of people .
Switch ?
What fucking switch ?
The switch .
Hit the switch .
<unk> of cake .
Good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
I can &apos;t tell you how thrilled I am to be here .
It &apos;s like a dream come true .
And speaking of dreams ... We need scissors over here !
Who &apos;s got scissors ?
Okay , remember .
Jack and I go on first , I do the set-up , then introduce you .
And you say ... You &apos;re a prince .
Don &apos;t worry .
We &apos;ll take it out of your share .
You can buy new ones tomorrow .
Well , they &apos;re <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> me up ?
What do you think ?
All right , but make it quick .
<unk> !
What size do you wear ?
Hey , pal .
I don &apos;t know about you , but where I come from there &apos;s a little girl &apos;s room and a little boy &apos;s room and the little boys don &apos;t go where the little girls go .
We &apos;re not exactly silly with time , you know .
Jack , you find anything ?
Save it for your wife .
Okay , okay .
Here , how about this ?
I wear a seven .
My wife wears a seven .
You don &apos;t look like a seven to me .
Just look .
What do you wear ?
A nine ?
If you ask me , this is pretty stupid .
Time for what ?
Come on .
We don &apos;t have much time .
Am I missing something ?
What &apos;s wrong with it ?
That !
You can &apos;t wear that !
Do I look like I &apos;m naked ?
Is there a language problem here ?
Your dress .
For tonight .
Where is it ?
What &apos;s he talking about ?
Where &apos;s your dress ?
We &apos;ll talk about it later .
Right now , you gotta get changed .
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster ?
Where &apos;s my name ?
Christ , look at her .
You &apos;d think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she &apos;d have enough sense to come in the back .
Good evening , Miss Diamond .
You &apos;re late .
So work with me , not against me .
Okay ?
We &apos;re a team .
We work together .
What I mean is -- No .
We are not supposed to be backing you up .
I mean , you &apos;re supposed to be backing me up , right ?
The problem is I can &apos;t hear myself sing with all this ... ... music .
You know what I &apos;m saying ?
What &apos;s the problem ?
What are we , an <unk> all of a sudden ?
Don &apos;t leave a girl hanging .
Second rule of show business .
When we know .
Uh ... we &apos;ll let you know .
That &apos;s the <unk> .
I sing now ?
Okay .
I think that &apos;s all we need to know .
Hey , it &apos;s legit .
<unk> dinner and dance .
Uh , well ... Is that important ?
They are in tune .
But not with each other .
Then I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t understand .
Yes , well , they are .
Tom here tells me there &apos;s a problem with the <unk> .
We were assured they were in tune .
That &apos;d be me , sir .
Frank Baker .
This is my brother Jack .
Good morning , gentlemen .
I &apos;m Mr. Daniels , the manager .
I believe I &apos;ve spoken to one of you on the phone .
We trust you , Lloyd .
You know that .
Lucky for you .
Well , there you go , guys .
Don &apos;t spend it all in one place .
Oh ... you want to count it , Jack ?
Born and <unk> .
Yes , sir .
That &apos;s quite a girl you boys <unk> onto .
She a local ?
I &apos;ll call you .
Uh , well , you know , the way our schedule is , I thought maybe ...
I &apos;ll call you .
Uh ... You don &apos;t know when you &apos;ll be wanting us back , do you , Lloyd ?
Uh ... thanks .
Yes , sir .
You &apos;re just what we needed on a night like this .
Terrific , boys .
Really .
Terrific .
I mean , I &apos;d hate to think I &apos;d pick up someone who wore that shit .
Shit , thank God .
You look like a creep .
Will I see you again ?
Whatcha doin &apos; over there ?
Right .
In there .
They never do , Mr. Barker .
He doesn &apos;t bite .
You should &apos;ve brought a <unk> , Mr. Barker .
The doctor doesn &apos;t like to be bitten .
Come on , Ed .
Right .
Bring him back .
Baker .
Jack Baker .
Barker .
<unk> Barker ?
You know , I &apos;m feeling a lot of hostility from you .
Don &apos;t worry about it .
So .
I &apos;m here , you &apos;re here , the piano &apos;s here .
What d &apos;ya say ?
All right .
they lay the dead ones out in the cold room .
I &apos;ll take a look .
Save it .
What &apos;s he look like ?
The name &apos;s Baker -- All right .
Hold on .
You want to know if he &apos;s okay .
Right ?
Yeah , well , couldn &apos;t I take a look now ?
You can check in on him tomorrow .
Between eight and five .
Yeah , yeah , I know .
I was just passing by .
Thought I &apos;d check in on him .
<unk> hours are eight to five .
No , I , uh , left a dog here this morning .
He needed some work on his mouth .
Yes .
I supposed you still have that old phone booth .
It &apos;s been a long time , Ma .
You miss him , don &apos;t you ?
Yes , well , it &apos;s probably best .
No sense bringing someone else in .
For a while .
She left .
He mentioned you had a girl for a while .
A singer .
Is that the way it is ?
He leads , I follow .
And you don &apos;t ?
Frank works hard .
It went well tonight .
I &apos;m tired .
Really .
I should get home .
Well , now , where &apos;s everyone run off to ?
Frank ?
Funny how life <unk> itself , huh ?
Over and over .
Like a song .
Thanks .
For letting me in last night .
I didn &apos;t want to wake you .
<unk> out in the morning .
Before the guy could wake up and ruin it .
Never figured I &apos;d be on the other end of it , though .
Let me get the light .
Well , this is some surprise .
Hey ... You don &apos;t look so good , pal .
If I see him .
Tell <unk> I said hi .
If you see him .
I &apos;ve given it up .
Listen ... you want to get a drink ?
I got a new place .
Or we could go to a bar ... Well , maybe not a bar .
But I know a place uptown , if you want -- Oh .
<unk> .
And <unk> .
None of the important ones .
Terrific .
I &apos;m doing <unk> next week .
So how &apos;s the cat food business ?
You don &apos;t pick your brother .
Yeah , well , like I said , it didn &apos;t figure .
You two .
We <unk> each other .
So ... ?
Yeah .
Got my own sign .
Saw the sign outside .
Got your own sign , huh ?
There &apos;s always another girl .
You can always get another girl .
If our feet get hot , you grab the piano .
Shit .
I think I started a fire .
Yeah , maybe ... No .
God , I hate these cigarettes !
Look , if you want to leave ... Oh .
Hi .
Sorry .
Frank wasn &apos;t &apos; there .
Frank said --- Ma didn &apos;t want it around .
After .
Wow .
But I still don &apos;t see how ...
I don &apos;t know .
Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her .
He calls her , asks her to marry him , she thinks he &apos;s crazy , he asks her again , she still thinks he &apos;s crazy but says yes anyway , and the next thing you know he &apos;s got his brothers down there and they &apos;re tearing the thing right off the curb .
So , what happened ?
He had a mind that <unk> things .
By the time he gets to the corner <unk> , he &apos;s got her meeting some rich guy on the train , the rich guy &apos;s asked her to marry him , and he &apos;s reading about it in the morning edition .
They &apos;d been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in <unk> .
Usually held ride with her , but this time he didn &apos;t .
Anyway , he starts walking home , only as he &apos;s walking he starts getting nervous .
You sending me home ?
Oh .
So what &apos;s it doing here ?
He called her .
The both of them ?
In there ?
My father proposed to my mother in there .
Yeah , they got a convention for everything .
At least he was clean .
Boy , the guys I met when I was with the service , you wouldn &apos;t believe .
The older ones , they were okay .
Nice .
<unk> .
<unk> the chair out for you .
But the younger ones ... Mama used to say , dance with a man once , but if you can feel <unk> on his fingers , don &apos;t dance with him again .
She thought she had it all figured out .
But she wasn &apos;t so smart .
There are killers with <unk> like a baby .
Must &apos;ve been a cheap date .
You know , I saw you guys once .
You and Frank .
At the <unk> .
How come you didn &apos;t close your eyes ?
Like diamonds , huh ?
I never get over it .
When I was a little girl , my mama &apos;d stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a <unk> I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them <unk> necklace for myself .
She &apos;d take my hand and when she closed her eyes , I don &apos;t know , it was like she really believed it .
I have to make him some chili .
Okay ?
Ed ?
How many people live here ?
She &apos;s four feet tall .
Ed ?
Friend ?
What &apos;s she look like ?
Maybe I can help you find her .
Because I saw the other people !
And they knew you were good !
You were good , goddamnit !
How do you know ?
You were good .
Let &apos;s make a deal .
You shut up .
You were good .
It means you wouldn &apos;t know good if it came up and fucked you .
What &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
Look .
You don &apos;t know good .
All right ?
All I said was you were good .
I &apos;m not upset .
What &apos;d I say ?
What &apos;s the matter ?
Better than that .
I can keep the beat .
Practice .
There are worse songs , you know .
Not many , but a few .
How do you do it ?
Every night ?
It &apos;s a shitty song .
Guess I got a little <unk> .
Relax .
We &apos;ll drop the song .
Just dinner and dance , right ?
It wasn &apos;t business .
It was pleasure .
Hey , business is business .
Yeah , well , thanks for sticking your head in .
No thanks .
I never touch French cigarettes .
If you want , I got a pack in the room .
In and out .
Like a baby .
You ?
Yeah , well , I wish God would go a little easy on the <unk> .
It &apos;s the waves .
God &apos;s music , my mother used to say .
She was crazy for the ocean .
In and out .
It &apos;s okay .
Last one .
Oh , sorry .
With the light always on , it &apos;s hard to tell .
I guess in case one year they &apos;re not .
So why &apos;s he do it ?
Aren &apos;t the kids asleep ?
He do that every year ?
Nothing personal -- I mean , that &apos;d be too creepy .
With us working together and all .
Hey , listen .
You &apos;re not going soft on me , are you ?
I mean , you &apos;re not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I &apos;m some kinda princess when I <unk> .
No .
Thanks .
She starts to move away , then stops and looks back .
You want me to walk you ?
You kidding ?
We must &apos;ve killed three pots in there .
Anyway , I gotta get home .
<unk> the <unk> .
Hey .
You feel like a cup of coffee ?
Mmm .
Like kissing a rose .
Well , <unk> revoir .
Paris <unk> .
<unk> cents .
I sat down with a pencil and added it one day .
But I figure , if you &apos;re gonna be sticking something in your mouth , you might as well make it the best .
Ah , here &apos;s a lost soul .
Nice place .
<unk> velvet .
Even the <unk> .
Damn !
<unk> a pack and I go through &apos; em like <unk> .
<unk> cents a piece , you believe that ?
Uh-uh .
I never touch American cigarettes .
What &apos;s tomorrow again ?
Yeah , well , <unk> I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame .
Shit .
He takes after our mother .
I don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s hard figuring you two as brothers .
Seems like the hospital might &apos;ve <unk> the babies somewhere .
His kid &apos;s sick .
Oh .
Well , for <unk> then .
Because <unk> Carson books the Park and whenever we &apos;ve needed a gig he &apos;s come through .
The Park ?
It &apos;s only two nights .
Why throw away a night ?
Look , they were all on their third <unk> <unk> by the time I got out there anyway .
Not for money .
With my mother .
You never sang before ?
He &apos;ll come around .
Hey , he &apos;s not sore , is he ?
He &apos;s got blood in his eye .
It ain &apos;t always a <unk> .
My brother here ?
Like <unk> .
You got a good memory , Jackie .
Another five years , huh ?
Yeah .
The big boys sent it down yesterday .
Yeah .
Jesus , you look like fucking <unk> , Tommy .
No shit .
It &apos;s the goddamn water .
Kill an <unk> .
I buy bottled for my Danny .
You can &apos;t trust the <unk> .
<unk> his teeth .
Ah , you know .
<unk> <unk> ?
That &apos;s what I want to do .
I want to make a snowman .
There were more flowers last year .
Mr. <unk> down at the drugstore says it &apos;s going to snow by New Year &apos;s .
Says he can feel it in his <unk> .
I hope it <unk> .
I want to make a snowman .
You ever make a snowman , Jack ?
Merry Christmas , Jack .
Can I stay here tonight ?
Even if she comes here ?
Eighty proof .
What d &apos;ya say ?
Think you can handle it ?
Not so good .
Okay .
How &apos;d yours go ?
How &apos;d the show go ?
He &apos;s just feeling sorry for himself .
This is it , pal .
Hear me ?
Two bucks a can .
I tried <unk> this morning .
He didn &apos;t even get up .
Maybe they took out the wrong teeth .
Ever go to church ?
What &apos;s a prom ?
Well , let &apos;s get your first prom under the belt , okay ?
Hey , what do you want to do ?
<unk> a beard ?
<unk> than me .
I hope not .
He &apos;s already busted the springs in two chairs .
Hey , what &apos;s this ?
Maybe he &apos;ll ask your ma to marry him .
I guess it &apos;s getting serious .
I saw his stuff in the bathroom .
How do you know ?
Oh .
<unk> gets his out of a can .
The recent past .
What are they ?
My days are not the old days , genius .
Is that what you used to do ?
In the old days , every man had a <unk> mug that he kept at the <unk> shop .
Then , whenever he wanted a shave , held go down to the <unk> shop and there would be his mug , waiting for him .
What happened to the <unk> king ?
<unk> <unk> .
Ma said it &apos;s like a lawyer only the hours are more regular .
All I know &apos;s he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner .
And breakfast .
Sounds big .
What &apos;s he do ?
Guess they &apos;re up .
Did you break a cup , Jack ?
He &apos;s losing his teeth .
Yes .
Right .
Eddie .
How is he ?
How &apos;s that dog of yours ?
What was his name ?
I &apos;m not much for <unk> .
Huh ?
Oh , no .
Big piece or little ?
So .
How are you ?
Good to see you , Ma .
John .
It &apos;s good to see you .
He hit a guard .
What did he do ?
They don &apos;t give two fucks about your health .
The <unk> &apos;s where they send the real <unk> for attitude <unk> .
Look at O <unk> -- You mean if I get sick ?
Not unless you &apos;re sent to the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Don &apos;t they ever let us take these boots off ?
You look great , Castor .
Really .
Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- <unk> .
Even has the worm .
Do I look wasted -- asshole ?
They never should &apos;ve voted against U.S. <unk> -- the <unk> .
We heard you got wasted .
<unk> <unk> .
Didn &apos;t Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian <unk> ?
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city , evacuate two million people on a hunch ?
I don &apos;t care -- he &apos;s <unk> it .
That bomb has been built and it &apos;s out there , somewhere .
Jon , he &apos;s hooked up to a <unk> polygraph .
No one has ever beaten -- Sorry , Admiral .
It wasn &apos;t mentioned in the job description .
Try to kiss my butt just once before I &apos;m transferred .
I &apos;m <unk> you .
Can &apos;t you ever just say &quot; thanks &quot; ?
Yeah , real fine .
Especially all the casualties .
Fine work , Jon .
You &apos;re not holding him right ... <unk> ...
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge .
Five .
No one knows you &apos;re his father .
I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you .
How old is he ?
Go on , Adam ...
I &apos;m not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you .
But hell , I never thought I &apos;d see you again , either .
Of course he is ... -- He &apos;s yours too .
Should be .
It &apos;s yours .
I &apos;m not the same person you remember .
Like I had a choice with that <unk> Jon Archer rising my ass at the <unk> hearing .
At least he took an interest .
You took off without leaving so much as a <unk> .
I hear you &apos;re a <unk> now -- got your own business and everything .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;ve stayed clean .
Better than you bleeding all over my car <unk> .
Trust me , <unk> , you won &apos;t be here long .
You shouldn &apos;t have brought me here ... it &apos;s dangerous .
Where am I ?
The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years <unk> .
Jesus Christ , Castor .
Yeah -- me .
<unk> , somebody &apos;s in trouble .
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen .
Or <unk> the first one .
He &apos;s your brother , you figure it out .
Maybe he made another bomb .
Why would he need more ?
Yes .
Pollux bought one along with the original <unk> .
Obviously , he found a way to make more .
And this thing can grow it ?
&quot; Thanks ? &quot;
I guess they really did fuck you up .
For being one helluva guy .
Being stuck in this <unk> when it blows .
<unk> , what you built was a work of art .
That little fucker belongs in the <unk> .
What &apos;s worse than losing five million bucks ?
That &apos;s not the worst part .
Only one you &apos;ve never broken .
And I bet I &apos;ve kept that promise ... After that .
You promised you &apos;d always take care of me .
Uh -- to kill the doctors ?
<unk> and <unk> while those bastards didn &apos;t even try to save her sorry ass .
You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some <unk> .
Oh , God -- Mom <unk> &apos;d at County General .
A few <unk> ?
Like what ?
I don &apos;t know .
Everything &apos;s <unk> -- so you &apos;re going to have to help me fill in a few <unk> .
You <unk> his wife the day he was arrested .
How could you forget that ?
Do you know what it is to be in a coma ?
It fucks up everything -- including your memory !
I can &apos;t even tell you why <unk> jumped me yesterday !
Let me have a look .
I was in a coma , Pollux .
I still feel like shit .
You shoot <unk> like a chick , you smoke like a <unk> , and -- I don &apos;t know -- you &apos;re different .
What do you mean ?
So ?
The <unk> <unk> is a South American bird .
The flight here was only three hours !
And yesterday a European swallow flew by !
Where the fuck are we ?
They haven &apos;t found it yet -- Listen , Pollux ... You &apos;re not my brother .
The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer .
At least tell me the bomb is still going off .
Hey , bro ...
I started wondering -- if you couldn &apos;t switch back -- would it make a difference ?
That &apos;s what they always say .
No life signs at all .
He &apos;s a <unk> .
How is he ?
Jon , if I &apos;m not there , he will be <unk> off .
I &apos;ll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together .
I know Lazarro -- the first person she &apos;d call is &quot; me . &quot;
We can &apos;t take the chance of <unk> Castor off .
Can &apos;t we call someone ?
Admiral Lazarro ?
The bomb .
He &apos;s <unk> it .
And everyone there is going to die .
Jon , what is it ?
You can &apos;t go .
You can &apos;t be anywhere near that place .
-- Or maybe all at once .
There &apos;s a <unk> tonight at New St. Marks .
For all the bureau chiefs and their families .
He &apos;s insisted Jamie and I be there too .
He &apos;s going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- <unk> .
What do you mean ?
Our Pacific <unk> stations .
These numbers must be <unk> .
Castor &apos;s not wasting any time .
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff .
I think it &apos;s a list of cities -- <unk> , Ho Chi <unk> City , <unk> ... Whatever happened , whatever he did -- I know it &apos;s my fault and I know I can never make it up to you -- Christ , Jon !
How could you do this to yourself ?
How could you do this to us ?
Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ... ?
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago .
What more proof do you need ?
I don &apos;t know that .
Maybe Jon &apos;s already dead .
Why point it at me ?
I &apos;m the real thing .
I took it from my fake husband .
An NSA surgeon gave me Castor &apos;s face .
He handled the transplant , the <unk> implant , everything .
But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission .
But not before he was <unk> into me .
How did he expect to do that ?
-- I called , but I &apos;m not Castor .
I &apos;m your husband .
I know you -- you &apos;re the one who called .
You &apos;re Castor <unk> .
You killed my son -- Don &apos;t hang up ... Whoever you are , don &apos;t call again .
Think about it , Eve !
Everything he &apos;s done recently has been <unk> , right ?
He &apos;s said and done things your husband would never do ...
Okay , you &apos;re having an emotional crisis .
You need to seek the help of a trained -- Never mind that !
Just take Jamie and get out of that house .
Don &apos;t tell anyone where you &apos;re going -- especially not him -- just GO .
Who is this ?
Eve , listen carefully .
The man you think is your husband -- isn &apos;t .
Is someone there ?
You want me to tell you it &apos;s okay to leave ?
Okay , go on !
GO !
I can &apos;t tell you ... except only I can do it .
You said you &apos;d be here !
You promised me -- you promised Jamie !
What could be more important than that ?
One last time .
It &apos;s important ... What are you saying ?
Oh , God -- you &apos;re going on assignment again ... And you wouldn &apos;t be .
Five years ...
I still can &apos;t get it out of my head -- an inch to the left , <unk> would still be alive .
I don &apos;t know ... Maybe because you &apos;ve never needed my help .
Were you there to catch me ?
Totally -- you were being very , very bad .
You went up in the plane and jumped out .
You had a <unk> , but it didn &apos;t open .
So you had a nightmare .
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother .
Must &apos;ve been after we got engaged .
We were back in high school .
You wanted to join the sky <unk> team , but I wouldn &apos;t let you .
...
I was dreaming ...
So is finishing my <unk> and passing my boards ...
I &apos;m late for surgery .
We need to talk .
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be .
You staying for a while or is this just a <unk> ?
Is that what you think ?
She &apos;s only 12 .
Some day she &apos;ll understand that <unk> and absence are just special ways of saying &quot; I love you . &quot;
Everything I say is wrong .
I can &apos;t talk to her anymore .
Well , you tried .
You failed <unk> , but you tried .
Just make sure you &apos;re there .
On time .
This is it , Jon .
For the next <unk> hours -- you &apos;re on your own .
Call Lazarro .
Castor just came out of his coma .
Either way , come Saturday morning -- I &apos;m pulling you the hell out of there .
Don &apos;t worry .
I &apos;ve done my homework .
I &apos;ll get Pollux to talk .
You haven &apos;t got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux .
Castor drinks , smokes and walks around with a <unk> hard-on .
He &apos;s nothing like you .
She doesn &apos;t know -- and she never will .
Jon , this is goddam insane .
You can &apos;t go through with it .
What about Eve ?
The left , I think .
Those surgeons in Witness <unk> can fix things nobody &apos;s even broken yet .
Which ear was it ?
He &apos;d see that a mile away .
The only person he &apos;d talk to about that bomb is his brother .
Unfortunately , <unk> can &apos;t talk .
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location .
Castor &apos;s still alive -- <unk> .
He &apos;s a <unk> , on total <unk> ...
Apparently , fine .
He &apos;s coming into work .
That &apos;s the good news ... You said it , Jon , not me .
I &apos;m not hiding in my work , if that &apos;s what you &apos;re saying .
I just asked you about making love to your wife , and you started talking about your job .
One of my <unk> spotted him -- right here in the city .
You &apos;re supposed to make time .
When was the last time you told her you love her ?
When was the last time you two had sex ?
I &apos;ve been working night and day .
I haven &apos;t had time .
You missed the last three , including her birthday .
Your wife &apos;s <unk> sheet .
Like <unk> , doc .
Okay , I missed the last one .
How is the &quot; date night &quot; idea going over with Eve ?
Not if I kill you first ... Give up , Castor .
People are going to find out .
I don &apos;t know .
How long before it kills us ?
<unk> globe ... shouldn &apos;t take long .
What -- what are you doing ?
Too late , your kid worships me .
And your wife -- she &apos;s an animal .
Even I can &apos;t keep up with her .
Stay away from my family !
You &apos;ve given me the freedom I haven &apos;t had in years , and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible .
But hell -- this is America .
One day a <unk> , the next day , a prince .
And I owe it all to you .
Now if you &apos;ll excuse me , I &apos;ve got an important government job to abuse , -- and a beautiful wife to fuck .
Excuse me -- I mean &quot; make love to . &quot;
What are you going to do !
Let &apos;s not <unk> things anymore .
I &apos;m Archer .
You &apos;re Castor .
But if you need proof -- What are you going to do , Castor ?
Of course I killed them , you <unk> FUCK .
And <unk> every shred of evidence that proves who you really are .
<unk> this one , Commander .
You are going to be in here for the rest of your life .
You killed them ?
I believe the phrase Dr. <unk> used was &quot; <unk> remote . &quot;
Who knows ?
Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out .
Or maybe God really is on my side after all .
By the way , I know you don &apos;t get the papers in here .
It can &apos;t be .
It &apos;s impossible .
Don &apos;t count on it .
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell .
You can &apos;t kill me , Jon .
I &apos;ve got something going this Saturday night ... it &apos;s gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the <unk> -- and only I can stop it .
<unk> my family once more and you &apos;re dead .
What &apos;re you gonna do with me gone ?
You &apos;ll drive your wife and kid nuts !
I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now .
What &apos;s her name , <unk> ?
You &apos;re under arrest .
<unk> , you still have the right to remain silent -- What &apos;s it to you ?
I declare it .
Here I am , back in the States for less than a month -- And how much will your &quot; fun &quot; net you this time ?
Jon , I &apos;m getting a little <unk> by your obsessive need to spoil my fun .
Or what ?
You &apos;ll have me fired ?
<unk> , you have to let me see the warden -- Archer cut him a deal for turning state &apos;s evidence .
He &apos;s free .
Pollux is -- what ?
You better be nice , Castor .
You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone .
I &apos;m going to have you fired .
So &apos;s a <unk> .
Now keep your mouth SHUT .
They &apos;re too tight .
Castor <unk> almost strangled me to death .
Where the hell were you ?
What &apos;s the matter with your voice , Commander ?
Just saving the <unk> the cost of a trial .
So take a hike .
I &apos;ve never been more certain of anything .
Get everyone in position .
-- And get the word out -- shoot to kill .
What makes you so sure this guy &apos;s gonna set up his own brother ?
We &apos;ve got him sighted .
Okay , Pollux , pull out .
Trust me , he &apos;s already here .
Get going !
<unk> ?
Castor isn &apos;t stupid enough to come back to the city .
Yeah , mom cut me some <unk> -- but I decided ...
I &apos;d like to be here for you .
Here , mom .
You can have it back .
Thanks , though .
There &apos;s my little darling .
The night wouldn &apos;t be complete without you .
I mean like protection .
You mean like ... <unk> ?
Did it look like I was siding with him ?
Did it ?
You want to play with the bad boys , you better be prepared .
Do you have protection ?
You haven &apos;t changed at all !
Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him !
What are you -- stupid ?
Like you know anything about it .
Get a higher <unk> on the ball , Jamie .
And for Chrissake , square your shoulders to the basket .
You &apos;ll be seeing a lot of changes around here .
Daddy &apos;s a new man .
When did you start smoking ?
I won &apos;t tell mom if you don &apos;t .
<unk> left those here .
Screw your boundaries , <unk> .
You have something I want .
Get rid of them .
You &apos;ve got someone in your office .
Let &apos;s try to be a little less formal from now on , shall we ?
You always call me Miss <unk> .
That &apos;s your name , isn &apos;t it ?
Well , I saw you -- <unk> .
Oh -- Commander .
I didn &apos;t see you ... You can &apos;t blame me for trying .
You &apos;re both in custody until there &apos;s a DNA <unk> and we can prove who &apos;s who .
Now put the gun down .
Obviously someone else knows it !
Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW !
It was confirmed by your personal security code .
Nobody knows that code but you !
<unk> you up !
Didn &apos;t you track Castor to the Army Street <unk> ?
Where should I be ?
Where &apos;s everyone else ?
Commander , what are you doing here ?
What the fuck do you think happened ?
Castor <unk> just shot him !
What are you waiting for ?
GO !
<unk> ?
From <unk> ?
I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the <unk> .
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off !
Like I fucking care ?
I &apos;m not just sitting here !
A lot of people think you &apos;re a snitch .
It &apos;s dangerous ... What about me ?
You &apos;ll need to <unk> that virus .
Good , because I checked your salary -- and it bites .
How the everyday <unk> stiff <unk> in today &apos;s economy is something I &apos;ll never ... All of them do .
We &apos;ll kill twelve birds with one bomb .
And we &apos;ll be rich .
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty <unk> prices on their heads .
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends .
Yeah -- it &apos;s Santa &apos;s <unk> fucking Village .
Your present &apos;s in here .
Eight pocket <unk> ... seven <unk> <unk> ... six <unk> <unk> ... five - net - <unk> ...
There &apos;s fun , bro .
Then there &apos;s <unk> .
I &apos;m just having some fun .
Are you <unk> to give us away ?
For somebody with such a big brain , you think awfully small .
Don &apos;t worry , nobody knows I &apos;m inside .
Check it out .
Remember that fat fuck agent who <unk> us up in <unk> ?
He &apos;s being treated for bone cancer at the <unk>
Thanks to the miracle of NSA <unk> ... -- Ooops !
His radiation does just <unk> .
You &apos;re supposed to be <unk> , making me look legit .
Don &apos;t get mad , but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches .
Trust me .
You &apos;re gonna love it ... No -- the best part is , since it &apos;s a government job -- they can &apos;t fire you !
But how can you be sure you &apos;ll get the appointment ?
-- I &apos;ll be one of the most powerful men in the country .
Didn &apos;t matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me .
The best part is -- I &apos;m the <unk> guy .
You better get used to it .
That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs .
Guess what <unk> family man is going to replace her ?
I can &apos;t even look at you without wanting to <unk> .
Business first .
I went into the &quot; <unk> &quot; system and erased your records .
You &apos;re clean .
In fact , you &apos;re now on the <unk> payroll .
You <unk> bastard !
Okay , then .
I leave it in your able hands .
No .
Most of them are in transit by now .
I &apos;m heading over to the hotel to personally <unk> security .
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs .
What is it , Admiral ?
I &apos;m under the gun here .
I just heard about Castor &apos;s <unk> -- rather poetic , don &apos;t you think ?
Jon , you &apos;re starting to remind me -- of me .
Congratulations .
Done .
In fact , I was already <unk> about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs .
You &apos;d have to start immediately .
I had doubts too .
I always looked at a desk as though it were a <unk> .
But something happened ... Me .
I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is <unk> a desk job .
D.C. &apos; s very high on giving you the promotion .
There &apos;s just one problem .
Just following your example .
You &apos;ve made us look pretty good in the past week .
And the way you handled the press -- You &apos;re the only person in this place who can see right through me .
Normally , I would .
But today ... Look at you , Jon -- at your age -- an American hero !
I &apos;d buy you a drink but I know you &apos;d just turn me down .
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna .
Didn &apos;t you ?
Back then -- who wasn &apos;t ?
Remember this from our junior prom ?
Boy , were you ever mad for Madonna .
Sure , baby -- go anywhere you want .
But I have to give you an escort .
Security reasons .
I &apos;m going to the powder room .
Good .
Because I &apos;m fed up .
I &apos;ll deal with her later .
That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to know .
She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off .
Okay , I have a confession to make .
But you aren &apos;t going to like it .
I disagree .
You think I &apos;ve been acting strange .
Like a completely different person .
What are you doing ?
I &apos;ll have a talk with her .
By the way , you never said anything about last night ...
Yes , Jon .
That Karl .
Oh , that Karl .
Great ?
He &apos;s 17 -- you told her to stay away from him .
I think Jamie &apos;s been seeing Karl again .
Okay , if you insist .
But -- you drive .
The world can wait , Jon .
You &apos;re going .
I &apos;m late .
Gotta protect and serve the world , y &apos;know .
Jon , it &apos;s the tenth .
I know how difficult it is for you , but we still have to go .
What &apos;s on your mind ?
Call me spontaneous .
You &apos;re wearing your suit -- So you see , I &apos;m not going anywhere .
Unless it &apos;s upstairs with you ... ... That &apos;s great .
I &apos;m replacing Lazarro .
Nice , safe desk job -- just like you wanted .
Can &apos;t you see I &apos;m trying to change ?
I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you .
I wanted to see the <unk> dance in your beautiful -- You always say that -- then you leave .
I &apos;m not going anywhere .
Isn &apos;t that what all this is about ?
<unk> Jamie go out , cooking me dinner , -- your next assignment ?
So -- how long will you be gone this time ?
You wouldn &apos;t even <unk> champagne at our wedding .
We were <unk> -- you wouldn &apos;t break the law .
Remember what my brother called you ?
Wouldn &apos;t be the first time -- or would it ?
I think -- you &apos;re trying to get me drunk .
They say love is blind .
Do you think that &apos;s true ?
Why do I feel like I &apos;m on a blind date ?
-- I &apos;ve got to study .
Hurry up -- the salad &apos;s getting warm and the <unk> &apos;s getting cold .
Don &apos;t I usually kiss my wife ?
What is with you tonight ?
Have fun at work .
Jon -- I don &apos;t have time to play games .
There &apos;re <unk> in the fridge .
The hospital ?
Oh , that &apos;s right -- you &apos;re a doctor .
<unk> .
It didn &apos;t work out as planned .
Where are you off to ?
As much as ever .
Nothing .
What do you know about it ?
What happened to your big &quot; assignment &quot; ?
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago ... the emergency <unk> session ?
Your trip to <unk> ?
They ’ re all panicked here ... Hey Santa , where are you ?
Everybody ’ s here .
That &apos;ll be a nice little holiday treat .
I &apos;ll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon .
Call the group .
<unk> an emergency <unk> session for noon .
She &apos;s probably just having a fit of <unk> .
You know , lonely Christmas Eve , call the one that got away , that kind of thing .
No ? !
You almost married this woman .
Aren &apos;t you even curious what she wants ?
And look where it &apos;s led you ...
I &apos;m gonna get her on the phone ...
I took the road less traveled , <unk> .
Stop Jack , I &apos;m getting all <unk> .
God , no .
I thought about it for practically the entire flight ...
So you left her ?
Just like that ?
She didn &apos;t want me to go to London .
We &apos;re standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay .
Almost married .
And almost a junior <unk> at <unk> <unk> ... Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college .
I almost married her ... Yeah Jack , her assistant ...
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight .
Ooh , my suits are ready ... Oh , and <unk> called ... You &apos;re a <unk> of <unk> , Jack .
You too ?
This holiday &apos;s about giving , <unk> .
And I &apos;m giving everything I &apos;ve got to this deal , so in a way , I &apos;m more <unk> than anyone ... <unk> ?
So what are we gonna do , Jack ?
Is this another one of those Sun <unk> “ Art of War ” tricks ?
But I think I like you better this way ... It ’ s not good .
Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company .
We ’ re not sure which one , Julia ’ s on it right now .
Word is they ’ re willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company .
The Global people are up in arms .
They say we should ’ ve been prepared for this .
We ’ re in trouble here , Jack ... What ’ s going on here ?
Jack , are you okay ?
Oh , I ’ m hearing you , Alan .
That ’ s not the problem .
The problem is that what you think is yours , is really mine .
And I don ’ t care how low on the <unk> pole I start , I will get it back ...
So do yourself a favor and don ’ t get too attached to that view because sometime soon , maybe very soon , you and your French country <unk> , your <unk> sofa , and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office .
I don ’ t think you ’ re hearing me .
Good for you .
Why shouldn ’ t you protect what ’ s yours .
... that ’ s our war room .
We did seven major deals last year , three of them hostile .
You drink about sixteen Diet <unk> a day .
You ’ re an excellent father , but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home .
You drink bourbon , but you offer your clients scotch ... What about me ?
Take you , for instance ... I ’ m sure you do ... And I know people .
It ’ s okay , Alan .
I get it .
I ’ m in your shoes , I ’ m thinking exactly the same thing ... but here ’ s the thing .
Business is business .
Wall Street , Main Street , it ’ s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning , trying to figure out how the hell they ’ re gonna send their kids to college .
It ’ s just people ... I ’ m not trying to knock the tire business , Jack .
Look , I know our <unk> little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year .
And I know some <unk> <unk> company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar <unk> ... Really .
So you ’ re projecting what , a tad over two million ?
Well , Alan , I think we ’ re gonna have a <unk> year .
<unk> are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major <unk> company account .
Uh huh ... one point seven .
And what do you project for this year ?
We did one point seven million in total <unk> ...
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year ?
<unk> ...
Uh ... we actually get about sixty percent of our business from <unk> service .
Uh huh .
The retail end , I understand .
That ’ s right .
And auto supply ... A <unk> ?
Really .
And now you ’ re in the tire business ?
I was a sales associate , at <unk> <unk> .
Uh ... actually , yes .
Two ... good ones .
You have kids , Jack ?
I can see that , Alan .
Please , call me Alan .
We try to <unk> a casual atmosphere around here ... Because my gift comes with ten <unk> at the end ...
I don &apos;t want you to be sorry , Alan , I want you to be excited .
I want my gift to be the first one you open this year .
You know why ?
You &apos;re right , Jack .
Sorry ... Jack approaches Alan .
I don &apos;t know .
Maybe ... You think I like being here on Christmas Eve , Alan ?
Is that tonight ?
Sorry , Jack .
I told <unk> and the kids I &apos;d be home by dinner .
You know , it being Christmas Eve and all .
I ’ m not worried , Mom .
He ’ s still learning our ways ... <unk> ’ s a part of it , Annie .
You know that , right ?
That ’ s right .
Okay , let ’ s make a quick stop at the kids ’ shoe department , pick up my watch from the battery place , then I ’ ll run into the <unk> store ... Mary <unk> , Mom .
You promised .
We ’ re almost done here ... Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land .
That could be her present ...
Mom , don ’ t you think we need to open the presents ?
You ’ re jumping , sweetheart ... No , honey .
Go back to sleep .
Is it morning yet ?
<unk> my bell ... What are you doing ?
Ah .
A classic ... Mary Had A Little <unk> .
Very nice .
What is it ?
Right .
That ’ s a major oversight ...
So if I ’ m Kate ... I can ’ t really afford the finer things , my husband ’ s career is a <unk> disappointment to me , I ’ m trapped in <unk> ... That ’ s good but ... you did forget the anniversary .
Maybe there ’ s a jewelry store back at the mall .
I could get her a pair of earrings or something .
Mom liked it .
Don ’ t you think that ’ s a little <unk> ?
One year he had a solar system named after her ... Not bad ... I shoulda warned you .
Dad always does something really special for their anniversary .
That ’ s where you work .
Big Ed ’ s ?
Big Ed ’ s <unk> ?
Why ... ?
Where do I go now ?
Got it .
Good tip .
Try not to be late because kids don ’ t like to be the last one picked up .
Five thirty .
Okay .
I have winter camp until four , then ballet until five thirty .
This is day care .
It ’ s where babies go when their parents are at work .
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains ?
I think I could figure it out .
You know how to make chocolate milk ?
On a case by case basis ... Do you like kids ?
Uhh ... thanks ... slightly better looking though , right ?
The aliens ... In the mother ship .
You look just like him .
They did a pretty good job .
I don ’ t know ... Where ’ s my real dad ?
This isn ’ t my real life .
It ’ s just a glimpse ...
Yeah ... I guess I just wanted you to know , we could ’ ve been really good friends ... You never really talked to me .
I wanted to talk to you , man ...
Yes , that ’ s it ... yes , we went to high school together .
Of course .
Jack Campbell .
I went to high school with you ... you played baseball , right ?
You ’ re doing well ...
Wait a second ... Jack ... Jack ...
I never won anything in bowling .
We bowl together .
We ’ re <unk> ... we won a <unk> ... we ’ re winners .
How ’ d you know my name ?
Tell me you recognize me , <unk> .
Please ...
I don ’ t care if you ’ re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools , you still can ’ t park here .
It ’ s me , Jack ... Hey , you can ’ t park that thing here .
It ’ s your birthday ?
Today ?
What ’ s your name ?
Where were you born ?
So Jack , it ’ s your wife ’ s birthday , got anything to say to her ?
All I ’ m saying it there isn ’ t a guy in Union County who wouldn ’ t give his left nut to be married to Kate ... Hey , is that really necessary ?
C ’ mon , Evelyn Thompson ’ s got no class .
She doesn ’ t marry Dr. Steve , the woman ’ s living in a trailer .
Screw the rules .
I ’ m talking about the choice .
I ’ m telling you , those rules don ’ t apply to me , <unk> .
Look , maybe I ’ m not as good a <unk> as you are but you have to trust me on this one .
A little <unk> ’ s harmless but you ’ re playing with fire here .
The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough <unk> .
You make a deposit somewhere else , they close your account forever .
It wouldn ’ t really be cheating ... It ’ s complicated .
Whoa ... whoa ... wait a second , Jack .
You ’ re not actually gonna cheat on Kate ?
So could you write down her exact address ?
Oh yeah ... What is it about you ?
She said that ?
She wants to have an affair with me .
She is <unk> .
I just saw Evelyn Thompson .
Hey Jack , you ’ re all flush .
I guess that <unk> took a lot outta you .
You ’ re right .
Why am I so competitive ! ?
<unk> , I guess .
Look , just focus , Jack .
You can still pick up the spare ... Hey , I ’ m doing the best I can ... I ’ d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers ... Where ’ s your follow through ?
Where ’ s your <unk> ?
Jesus , Jack , this is a league match , for god ’ s sake !
It ’ s just two kids , right ?
Look , you fit the profile exactly .
<unk> , house , kids , financial responsibilities .
You start thinking ... this isn ’ t the life I dreamt about .
Where ’ s the romance , where ’ s the <unk> de <unk> ?
Suddenly , every lingerie ad in the <unk> Star <unk> represents a life you can ’ t have ... Kate ’ s my wife ... You see , it ’ s like we ’ re in each other ’ s heads ... It ’ s not Kate , is it ?
I don ’ t think so .
Trouble at work ?
What am I saying ?
You don ’ t need to hear that ... All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced <unk> , that ’ s all .
Is that you ?
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays ... I ’ m having kind of a bad day .
Maybe I don ’ t say it enough but you moving in next door to me ... We ’ re friends , aren ’ t we ?
I know , I moved the <unk> into the corner .
It ’ s throwin ’ everybody off .
What do you think ?
I mean it .
From what I can tell , we ’ re a mom and pop operation , we ’ re already <unk> in sales , and any price advantage we could offer would easily be <unk> by a larger <unk> ... I ’ ve got all the time in the world ... Got a minute , Jack ?
The Caddy ?
Why don ’ t you take your own damn car !
Look , can I just borrow your car ? !
I promise it ’ ll be returned !
What the hell are you talking about ?
What ’ s he talking about ?
Where ’ s my car ? !
Where ’ s my <unk> ! ?
You know what the word glimpse means , <unk> ?
It ’ s by nature an <unk> thing .
I ’ ve got kids , I ’ m going home ... You can ’ t do this .
You can ’ t keep coming in and out of people ’ s lives , messing things up ... Look Jack I ’ m late .
I ’ d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business ...
Happy <unk> .
But what do I do ?
Do I look like I live in a bottle ?
What ’ s this , a signal ?
Will you come whenever I ring it ?
Look Jack , in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it ... let it come to you .
That ’ s it ?
That ’ s all I get ? !
A <unk> ? !
Figure it out ?
Figure what out ? !
Because you got to figure it out for yourself .
Are you listening to me ?
Do I look like I need your money .
It doesn ’ t work like that and I can ’ t tell you why .
Look , I just want my life back .
Now what ’ s it gonna take ?
You wanna talk turkey ?
Let ’ s talk turkey !
How much money ... ?
As long as it takes to figure it out .
Which , in your case , could be considerable .
How much time ? !
Figure it out .
You got plenty of time .
I asked you a direct question !
A glimpse of what ? !
Look , eventually , everybody gets one ... some of <unk> em take a couple seconds ... ... some of <unk> em take a lot longer ...
I glimpse ?
A glimpse of what ! ?
What glimpse ? !
<unk> !
It ’ s a glimpse , <unk> .
Please .
Just tell me what ’ s happening to me .
In plain English .
None of that <unk> <unk> ... You ?
What about me ?
I ’ m working hard for you here , Jack .
On Christmas too !
Now you did a good thing last night , <unk> that way .
I was moved ... Give me my goddamn life back !
Everyone else in that store is a statue , they see their lives passing in front of their eyes , but not you .
You ’ re making a business deal ... You mean because you thought I was cocky I ’ m now on a permanent acid trip ? ! !
No ?
C ’ mon , Jack ... I ’ ve got everything I need , I don ’ t have regrets , that ’ s just not for me ... sound familiar ?
<unk> what on myself ? !
I didn ’ t do anything !
Look , I don ’ t know what you ’ re getting so worked up about , you did this ... you brought this on yourself .
What the hell is happening to me ? !
Might wanna <unk> your seat belt , Jack ... <unk> , it ’ s my car now .
Get in .
It ’ s a <unk> asset seized in <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of your <unk> contract ... That ’ s my car !
You stole my car !
Miss me , Jack ?
Oh man , I &apos;m gonna enjoy this one ... Just remember , Jack , you did this .
You brought this on yourself ... Sure it &apos;s about you .
But it &apos;s about society , too .
You still think this is about me , don &apos;t you ?
Look , I &apos;m not saying you &apos;d be able to do it without some hard work ... Wow .
It must be great being you .
You got it all .
I &apos;ve got everything I need .
You just said everyone needs something .
Yeah ?
What do you need ?
Everyone needs something .
Oh man , you &apos;re serious ...
This man thinks I need to be saved !
Wait a minute , wait a minute ... you &apos;re tryin &apos; to save me ?
I mean there must be <unk> out there , opportunities ... Yeah , in most cases that &apos;d be true .
I &apos;m just saying that you seem like a smart guy .
At a certain point you &apos;re gonna do something , and then there &apos;s no turning back ... You want to talk about regrets , you &apos;re talking to the wrong person .
What do you want to carry that gun around for , anyway ?
You &apos;re just gonna do something you &apos;ll regret ...
Okay , Jack .
Nice doing business with you ... <unk> is about to take off ...
I don &apos;t do that .
That &apos;s just not for me ...
So you &apos;re telling me , you &apos;ve got a gun to your head and you don &apos;t think for one second , what if this , what if that , maybe I shouldn &apos;t do this , I shoulda done that .
A lucky streak , huh ?
There &apos;s no way I was gonna die in that <unk> ... Let &apos;s just say I &apos;ve been on a lucky streak lately .
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him .
I call all you white guys &quot; Jack . &quot;
How &apos;d you know my name was Jack ?
Damn , you are the real thing ... Like I said , it &apos;s a business deal ... Look , I &apos;m talking about a business deal here .
I buy the ticket for two hundred , take it to a store where the guy behind the counter ... ... doesn &apos;t have a death wish ... I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars .
Yes you do ... DO YOU <unk> <unk> ? !
You first <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , hot <unk> sandwich making ... You leave now .
Take ticket somewhere else .
Next customer in line ... !
Get out , I call <unk> .
What ! ?
Look at the ticket ... !
You draw lines with pencil !
I know about this !
What &apos;re you talkin &apos; about ?
<unk> bad .
You draw in lines with pencil .
... <unk> ... <unk> ... 18 ... 48 ... right there .
Four numbers ... that &apos;s two hundred and thirty eight dollar ... Merry Christmas and shit ...
Okay , you ’ re right , we ’ ve been dancing around this for years ...
It would help me if we were .
Are we finally being honest ?
Is there something going on between us ?
Are we what , Jack ?
You ’ re a nurse ?
Need a nurse ?
Something like that .
Very funny .
I saw you out there on lane five .
What do you have the flu or something ?
Well do whatever it is you do well , and just ... just do it .
Excuse me ... <unk> <unk> aren ’ t the only thing I do well ... C ’ mon , as soon as I put them down , you ’ re gonna grab a couple ... you always do ...
I don ’ t think so , thank you ...
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids ’ <unk> .
Like the dress ... ?
Maybe you ’ re not hearing me .
I am Jack Campbell ...
Right here .
Jack Campbell , President ...
I don ’ t care who you are .
It ’ s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed .
Look , I don ’ t know what ’ s going on here but I am <unk> Vice President of this company .
Mr. <unk> ?
I don ’ t think so ... building ’ s closed pal .
You ’ ll have to come back tomorrow .
Frank .
Where ’ s Alan <unk> ?
Is he here yet ?
Whoa , whoa , whoa ... hold it right there ...
Thanks .
To you too ... Merry Christmas to you , sir ... Nice night for it .
I &apos;ll have Louis send your car home .
I &apos;m thinking I might walk tonight , Frank .
Why don ’ t you let me take this one , Kenny ?
You want me to handle him ?
I think I ’ m ready ...
If you ’ re into that kind of <unk> <unk> ... Kate ’ s on two , Jack .
Nice ride ... Well , I ’ m just a little confused right now about why I work here ...
Here we are , mag wheels ... Hey Jack , are you sure you ’ re okay ?
I mean sales has always been a <unk> for M and A , always ... That ’ s the kind of thing you can really build on ... No , I didn ’ t ... that ’ s great .
... I was the number one junior sales associate at <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Did you know that ?
Uh ... sure Jack ...
Right back there ... Do I have a private office somewhere in the building ?
What are you talking about ?
It ’ s me , Jack Campbell .
Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper !
Sorry , pal .
<unk> is for <unk> and guests only ... Just until the <unk> Mark turns ... About four grand .
And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in <unk> .
I ’ m putting it all in commercial paper like you said .
How ’ d you do this year , Tony ?
Merry Christmas , Mr. Campbell .
We have two kids , Annie and Josh ... Don ’ t do this , Jack ...
But he continues ... What do you want from me ?
You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay ?
Please .
Let ’ s just go have a cup of coffee .
That ’ s all I ’ m asking for .
I ’ m sure there ’ s another flight to Paris tonight .
Don ’ t get on that plane !
You can ’ t go !
Not exactly ... Can we just take a minute here ?
Maybe get a cup of coffee or something ... ?
No , Jack , I never got married .
You ?
You ’ re not married , are you ?
Not with what they pay me ...
So you ’ re not at a <unk> profit firm ?
That ’ s the one ... To Paris .
Paris , France .
Uh huh .
To Paris .
My firm has an office there and I ’ m going to be heading it up .
I ’ m moving to Paris ... it was right here ... It ’ s a box marked “ Jack . ” I put it in the stack for the <unk> Army ... What ’ s going on ?
Don ’ t worry about it , Jack ... It ’ s good to see you ... You look great .
Jack ... God , it ’ s been so long ... You look ...
I promise .
Come to bed , honey .
Promise me again ...
I promise , Jack ...
Please , just promise me you ’ ll do that .
You have to promise , Kate .
Because if you don ’ t , then it ’ s like it never happened and I don ’ t think I could live with that .
Are you okay , Jack ?
I need you to remember me , Kate .
How I am right now , right this very moment .
I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you , no matter what happens .
You ’ ve been Jack Campbell .
And that ’ s always a good thing ...
But I ’ ve done some good things too , haven ’ t I ?
It ’ s been interesting , that ’ s for sure .
Look , you ’ re making this into something it ’ s not .
This isn ’ t a <unk> on our lives , Kate .
It ’ s a step forward ... Don ’ t you see ?
I ’ m talking about us finally having a life other people envy .
Don ’ t do that ... Then get a goddamn snow <unk> !
I can do that .
I want to do that .
For all of us .
I need to do that as a man ...
Think about it .
No more lousy restaurants , no more <unk> coupons , no more shoveling snow ... No , this is the center of the universe .
If I were living in <unk> times , I would live in Rome , where else ?
Today , America is the <unk> Empire and New York is Rome itself .
John <unk> .
I can ’ t believe you want to move back into the city .
I thought the reason we left was because we didn ’ t want to raise the kids here ?
This is New York City , it ’ s like the needy people capital of the world .
Those Jersey clients of yours aren ’ t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here ... Jack , what could you possibly be thinking ?
What about my job ?
I ’ m talking about the best schools in the country here , Kate ... Annie goes to a great school .
I don ’ t think so .
This is going to be a better life for all of us , honey .
We ’ ll put Annie and Josh in private schools ... Are you out of your mind ?
What are you talking about , Jack ?
You ’ re talking to their new Vice President of <unk> and <unk> .
A company called <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk> House uses it to attract new executives ... A perk for what ?
This place is a perk , Kate .
For the week ?
So what ’ s the big surprise ?
You didn ’ t rent this place for the weekend , did you ?
It ’ s like a museum .
Pretty incredible , isn ’ t it ?
I don ’ t think I ’ d fight you on that one ...
I could stay here forever ... That ’ s all I wanted to hear ... My god , all this time ... I never stopped loving you ...
I already told you you were gonna get lucky , Jack ... I ’ m out of the <unk> ?
I don ’ t know how you did it , <unk> , but you pulled it off .
I ’ ll just full yours up to the top .
Happy anniversary , sweetheart .
You know champagne makes me do crazy things .
What are you sure about ?
Imagine having a life where everything was easy ... where you asked for things and people just brought them to you ... God , sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a <unk> player ...
I guess ... some of them are probably faking .
I mean yes , I help people that need it ...
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks .
My office is a dump , I answer my own phone ... and you ’ ve seen my pay check .
That ’ s a big one for me , too .
C ’ mon , Jack , you think there aren ’ t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I ’ m doing in New Jersey ...
But you always seem so certain .
I think it ’ s good to be a little <unk> about who you are .
It ’ s very human .
I never used to be like this , Kate .
I had it all figured out .
No doubts , no regrets .
No .
Well , maybe a few things .
But mostly just different ...
Worse , you mean ...
I used to be so sure about everything , you know ?
I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted .
Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different ... Are you sure ?
Now I ’ m worried ... just say it .
Whatever it is we ’ ll deal with it .
I think it may help us but there ’ s a slight chance it could make things worse .
I need to tell you something .
But I ’ m gettin ’ close , right ?
You are so not off the hook yet , slick .
How do you even know about this place ?
What ’ s the difference ?
I ’ m taking my baby out for our anniversary , damn the costs ... Jack ... can we afford all this ?
I ’ ll fix it .
I ’ ll go out right now and get you something .
I ’ ll make it right .
You actually forgot our anniversary .
I know that , but ... What are you talking about ?
You never wait all day .
You can barely wait until it ’ s light out .
Here ’ s the thing .
I really hadn ’ t planned on giving you your ... uh ... anniversary gift until tonight .
You know , anniversary ’ s good all day ...
Enjoy it , sweetheart ... You really are incredible ...
I found it at an <unk> store .
I know it ’ s a <unk> , but I think it ’ ll look great on you ... No , open it ... Maybe I should wait ...
Wait a minute .
You ’ re my wife ?
What ?
You make me hot ... Nice , Jack .
You ’ re sweeping me off my feet .
Oh yeah , you ’ re a bad girl , baby ... You make me so hot ... I ’ m gonna take you to that special place ... Then say it ... just say it to me ... !
Yeah , baby , I know what you like to hear ... C ’ mon , you know what I like to hear ... Say it , Jack ... It ’ s good , right ?
I want it ... You want the cake ! ?
Sorry , Jack .
It ’ s too important to me .
That ’ s my piece .
I was saving it because I got <unk> from that store bought chicken .
You mean this chocolate cake ?
Long , boring , and generally pretty sad .
<unk> seemed to enjoy it ... Hey , where ’ s that chocolate cake ... ?
How was the game , honey ?
How would you look at it ?
If you want to look at it that way ... Our life in a <unk> ... That ’ s why I work for Big Ed ?
Jack , stop that .
I &apos;m still mad at you ... ... who knows what would ’ ve happened if you hadn ’ t stepped in at the store .
You had a heart attack ?
The <unk> out to the hospital every day didn ’ t help either ... You were great .
<unk> the heart attack was one thing ... You can ’ t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village ... Charles Street ?
In the Village ?
When we were living in <unk> Village ... ?
Great times .
Why ’ d we ever leave ?
We were young ...
Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to ?
No , I love Annie .
We had a lot of good times , didn ’ t we ?
Good , Jack .
Maybe we ’ ll keep her .
Sure .
I really like Annie .
I think it worked out okay , don ’ t you ?
Surprise .
We ’ re pregnant ... Yeah ... that must ’ ve been ... I mean that was very unexpected .
But what are you gonna do , right ?
Well ... Annie for one .
Maybe you ’ re not .
The Jack Campbell I married wouldn ’ t need a $ <unk> suit to make himself feel better about his life , but if that ’ s what it ’ s gonna take , then buy it .
Just buy the goddamn suit ... we can take the money out of the kids ’ college fund .
Look , I ’ m sorry .
I ’ m sorry I was such a saint before and I ’ m such a prick now .
Maybe I ’ m just not the same guy I was when we got married ...
I can ’ t believe it ’ s not a disappointment to you !
Jesus , Kate , I could ’ ve been a thousand times the man I became .
How could you do this to me ?
How could you let me give up on my dreams like this ? !
It ’ s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you , Jack .
What ’ s in it for me ?
Where are my Mary <unk> ?
I pick up the kids , walk the dog , which by the way , carries the added bonus of <unk> away her <unk> crap ... I play with the kids , take out the garbage , get six hours of sleep if I ’ m lucky , and then it starts all over again ... and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere ?
I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell <unk> listening to <unk> tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work ... I ’ m sick of it .
I wake up in the morning covered in dog <unk> ... I drop the kids off , spend eight hours selling tires retail ... retail , Kate .
Do you have any idea what my life is like ?
Those shoes were twenty five dollars .
C ’ mon , take it off .
We ’ ll go to the food court and get one of those <unk> <unk> you like .
She got those shoes ...
$ <unk> ? !
Are you out of your mind ?
It ’ s an unbelievable thing .
<unk> this suit actually makes me feel like a better person .
I ’ m gonna buy it ...
I mean ... wow ... off the charts great .
Look at me like you haven ’ t seen me every day for the last twelve years ... How can you do that ?
I mean back in college , you were a very pretty girl , there ’ s no question about that .
But this ... ... you ’ ve really grown into a beautiful woman ...
This is good stuff , Jack , keep it coming ... No , I ’ m serious ... you ’ re really <unk> ... Whatever you say ... honey .
It ’ s ten thirty , Jack .
By eleven you ’ re gonna be <unk> out on the bed <unk> your head off .
We don ’ t have time for <unk> and dining .
Shouldn ’ t we grab some dinner first ?
Maybe a bottle of wine ... ?
That is the general idea , yes ...
Wait a second .
You want me , don ’ t you ?
I ’ m working on a new deal now ...
I thought we had a deal about you watching <unk> in bed .
Hey !
I was watching that !
Well that ’ s just great ... those little monkeys can be a real handful ... Jack .
I said the kids are asleep ...
Uh ... that baby ’ s crying ... ... my feet are <unk> ’ ... You ’ re having a bad day , I ’ ll go with you ... actually , there ’ s no way in hell you ’ re gettin ’ me back out there ...
But it ’ s twenty degrees outside ... Fine , she ’ s the kid ’ s dog .
Let ’ s go wake Josh , see if he wants to walk her .
No , she ’ s not .
She ’ s your dog , Jack .
You ’ re kidding me ...
Here you go ...
Pro <unk> .
You don ’ t get paid at all .
Nobody makes a dime .
Well , <unk> ...
Yes , I ’ m fine .
It ’ s just this god awful football phone !
Who has a phone like this anyway ? !
Funny , Jack .
I ’ m laughing on the inside .
Christ ... Where the hell is the bathroom ?
Because you ’ ll be here .
Telling my mother she doesn ’ t have to stay with the kids .
What are you doing ?
Trust me on this Kate .
I really don ’ t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time .
You look forward to this party all year .
What ’ s with you today ?
Party ?
Oh no , I can ’ t go to a party ... Look , we don ’ t have time for this right now , we ’ ll talk about it later .
Now get dressed ... You ’ re not wearing that to the <unk> ’ party .
I don ’ t care how hilarious you think it is ... Look , you don ’ t understand .
I woke up here ... and this is very strange ... this is not my house ... Jack ... don ’ t even start ... Because that ’ s where I live .
The city ?
New York City ?
Why ?
I was in the city .
Where were you ?
I don ’ t know !
Please stop yelling at me !
What kind of man does that ! ?
Are you okay ?
You hear me complaining about that ?
I can &apos;t seem to let go of you ... We &apos;re being responsible .
Go .
Get on the plane .
No , you ’ re right .
What are we doing ?
Go .
I ’ m sorry , you should just go ...
Right , for us .
But ... I ’ m afraid that if you get on that plane ... For us , Kate .
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you ... You mean don ’ t go at all ?
What about my <unk> ?
Don ’ t go , Jack ...
I know we ’ ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do .
But in my heart ... this feels wrong .
About the plane ?
What do you think it ’ s gonna crash ?
Don ’ t say that ...
I have a bad feeling about this .
I also put side two of London <unk> on there ... All in one tape ?
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way ... A shelter ? !
I ’ m the richest guy in the building ... I ’ ve got twice the square footage you have !
And sleep you shall .
<unk> oblige is not dead .
Not yet anyway ... Come , let ’ s get you some help .
<unk> there must be a shelter somewhere in this city .
Thank you , Betty .
I know if I can just sleep this off , I ’ ll be fine ... You know you could never satisfy me the way he does ... It ’ s because I ’ m shy , Betty .
So , when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me ?
Hello Jack .
You don ’ t have to stop singing on my account ...
Okay ... you smoke <unk> de <unk> .
You ’ re a scotch man , single <unk> , not because it ’ s trendy but because you ’ ve been doing it for forty years , and you stay with what works .
You have two great loves in your life , your horses and this company .
You <unk> openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand ... That ’ s easy .
You ’ ve seen my car .
For one thing , you like expensive things .
You ’ re a little tougher , Peter .
He certainly has your number , Alan .
But you ’ re not interested in <unk> dollars ...
I get it ... ... we ’ re really more of a <unk> operation , as you can see ... Not exactly .
I ’ ve seen you on <unk> .
You look taller in real life ... Do I know you ?
Then leave it in the past .
Old flames are like old tax returns .
You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose .
Not by a long shot .
You suddenly having trouble getting dates ?
Hey Peter , lemme ask you a question .
An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve ... Where is he ?
I need you , tiger .. Why are you staring at my breasts , Peter ?
Someone &apos;s gonna have to nurse him through this .
That &apos;ll happen when you &apos;re about to spend thirty billion dollars on some <unk> ...
I just got a call from Terry <unk> .
Bob Thomas is nervous ... And God love you for it .
That &apos;s because I &apos;m a <unk> bastard who only cares about money .
Peter .
I don &apos;t see you rushing home to <unk> the tree .
I ’ m sorry , no ... Hey , my wife ’ s in the kitchen .
You got a cigarette ?
Is there anything I can do for you ?
Hey , are you okay ?
Kate ?
No , there ’ s no one here named Kate .
Is that good enough for you ?
Is Kate here ?
Does Kate live here ? !
Can I help you ?
You won ’ t regret it ... Tommy !
Set Mr. <unk> up with four <unk> <unk> <unk> T / A ’ s ... ... and give him ten percent off for having the best costume ...
Okay , I ’ ll take them ... For the money , they ’ re hands down the best <unk> we carry ... Christmas ?
It can ’ t be Christmas ... That ’ s totally see through ...
If it &apos;s something you feel strongly about .
Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning ...
Okay ?
I &apos;ve got plenty of places to go .
Don &apos;t you have anywhere to go ?
I &apos;m taking the train ... Jersey ?
You know what the traffic &apos;s gonna be like ?
I have to go to my parents &apos; house out in Jersey .
Would you like to come ?
So we &apos;ll get egg <unk> .
It &apos;s Christmas Eve , Jack .
I &apos;d like that , too .
I want to see you again .
Thanks .
You &apos;re not bad yourself ... You are an amazing lover .
You should be giving <unk> <unk> .
Last night was great ... Of course I did .
Did you really mean what you said about <unk> ?
Congratulations .
The La <unk> flight ’ s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine .
Am I good or what ?
I found it !
I ’ ll go for a cup of coffee !
Maybe it ’ s by the wardrobe boxes ... You didn ’ t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were <unk> that <unk> bag I gave you .
Hey , kind of giving up Christmas day for my <unk> here .
Hey , kind of under a little pressure here .
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline ?
Tell me .
When you grew up in Brooklyn , how many <unk> did you know ?
You went your own way then .
You didn &apos;t listen to people .
So why start now ... ?
I wouldn &apos;t know anything about that .
You don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like out there .
<unk> around like some kind of circus freak .
People staring , whispering -- This ain &apos;t permanent .
My friend Reed &apos;s working on a cure ... I think .
&quot; <unk> blind chick <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> for deep spiritual relationship . &quot;
You know , you could &apos;a run an ad in the <unk> .
I like the sound of that .
We &apos;re going to have to work on your touch .
My <unk> &apos;s .
I &apos;m strictly into stone .
I was wondering when you &apos;d walk by .
Those yours too ?
No , I mean ... I &apos;m a little ... <unk> ...
Relax , it &apos;s casual .
I &apos;m not really dressed for a party .
I &apos;m blind , not deaf .
Wanna come in ?
How &apos;d you know it was me ?
Trust me , this ain &apos;t one of those times .
Such a sad face ... You know , sometimes being different isn &apos;t a bad thing .
You wouldn &apos;t say that , if you could see me .
I don &apos;t think She &apos;s real big on hate .
Forget it , <unk> .
I &apos;m good as is .
Ben , I &apos;ve been <unk> the numbers on the machine .
I think if we can <unk> the power <unk> ... Got it , teach .
Time for &lt; u &gt; your &lt; / u &gt; lesson , Vic .
<unk> <unk> : what happens when you &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; hot metal ... ?
Ben ... Ben , I don &apos;t know if this thing &apos;ll change us back or make us worse .
I need you to be patient for a little while <unk> Glad &quot; nothing &quot; could take you away from your work .
Yeah .
I can tell .
Victor was right .
We &apos;re working as hard as we can -- Oh , you remember my name do you ?
You happen to remember what you &lt; u &gt; swore &lt; / u &gt; to do with every breath in your body ?
This isn &apos;t permanent , Johnny .
We need to be careful until we &apos;re normal again .
It &apos;s about to be a broken face .
<unk> .
We &apos;ll skip that question .
Not unless you want that <unk> <unk> up your -- Ben , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve got to ask -- Yeah .
You don &apos;t wanna know the details .
Okay .
I &apos;ve uh , got some questions , from Sue .
That she thought might be better coming from me ... Can you , you know , go to the bathroom ... like normal ...
If we &apos;re going to identify the source of the <unk> , we need to <unk> your <unk> DNA so we can <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You got a <unk> round here ?
Yeah , nine years straight .
We had a tough year .
Am &lt; u &gt; I &lt; / u &gt; okay ? !
You wanna explain that ? !
Ben .
Are you okay ?
What the -- !
I think I need to lie down .
Bad shrimp .
Are you alright ?
Well maybe &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; should date him .
He &apos;s smart , powerful , successful -- I &apos;m sorry , did that <unk> loosen your <unk> ?
What ?
Come on .
She &apos;s got a good thing with Victor -- Reed , I &apos;m not talking about <unk> .
Yeah , you and <unk> and perfect -- You go through something like this , makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life .
I should have done more , run more tests -- Reed .
Even &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; can &apos;t <unk> every little thing .
I don &apos;t know .
I just keep going over and over the numbers .
Three days .
I was worried about you .
How are you feeling ?
How long was I out ?
Ben .
This is serious .
&lt; u &gt; Turn around &lt; / u &gt; .
I ain &apos;t done <unk> your flowers , <unk> .
The shields on the station should protect us .
Victor &apos;s better at these things .
This is your dream , Reed .
You should be the one up there .
He &apos;s made a few changes .
Isn &apos;t that &lt; u &gt; your &lt; / u &gt; speech ?
This makes five .
I had it at four .
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do ?
I &apos;m sure he &apos;s <unk> since then .
They crashed it into a wall .
A flight &lt; i &gt; simulator &lt; / i &gt; .
<unk> high spirits .
No .
I cannot take orders from that underwear model .
That <unk> washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret <unk> into a flight simulator .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> system engines .
Its just like the <unk> you flew in -- Can &apos;t do it .
I cannot do it .
I know , I know .
I &apos;m just worried about what &lt; u &gt; he &lt; / u &gt; wants ...
Speaking of which ... We got what we wanted .
That &apos;s &lt; u &gt; enough &lt; / u &gt; .
Maybe you should think about &lt; u &gt; yourself &lt; / u &gt; for once .
You always let this guy push you round -- Ben , think about all the people we can help if this works -- He &lt; u &gt; knew &lt; / u &gt; about NASA .
What if he made the call to shut us down -- Ben , the money &apos;s not important .
We could &lt; u &gt; save lives &lt; / u &gt; .
What about his first born ?
Ben .
This is business .
Just work .
I can &apos;t take this .
You &apos;d never know it .
He &apos;s financed some of the biggest <unk> of this century .
This wasn &apos;t our first stop , in case you forgot NASA .
And Victor &apos;s not that bad .
He &apos;s just a little ...
<unk> than life .
Good thing it ain &apos;t workin ... Reed , what are we doing here ?
This guy &apos;s <unk> , <unk> science -- Hey , I &apos;m Mr.
<unk> now .
Clear the way , wide load coming through .
No more cracks about how I look .
Really ?
With a name like Von &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; ?
Never saw &lt; u &gt; that &lt; / u &gt; one coming .
The machine works .
And Vic &apos;s gone Mister Hyde on us -- Go back to the drawing board .
Hey !
That &apos;s a &lt; u &gt; prototype &lt; / u &gt; !
Give me the god damn mirror !
They said that &apos;s not such a good idea , the shock alone could -- Give me a mirror ...
I swear to you they &apos;ve done everything <unk> possible .
The best plastic surgeons in the world , Ben .
You had the best -- What &apos;s wrong with me ?
They &apos;re fine .
Everybody &lt; i &gt; else &lt; / i &gt; ... is fine .
Reed ?
... Sue ?
Back on Earth .
Victor &apos;s medical facility ... We &apos;re in quarantine .
Where ... where am I ?
Don &apos;t you wander off , boy .
Put your tiny little mind at ease .
Let &apos;s see : you got Victor , stud of the year , more coin than God ?
Or Reed , the world &apos;s <unk> smart guy worth less than a <unk> stamp .
Hmmm , it &apos;s a <unk> .
Hey , two hearts got busted last time .
Maybe she &apos;s not over it either .
Yeah , well , his eyes say different .
&apos;Course not .
<unk> business .
Please tell me your <unk> &apos;s not trying to <unk> things with my sister .
Keep talking , there won &apos;t &lt; u &gt; be &lt; / u &gt; a next time .
If you behave , maybe next time daddy &apos;ll let you drive .
Actually , the engines are <unk> .
<unk> , carbon <unk> .
Couple generations past your last ride .
I &apos;m not as dumb as you look .
What the hell you smiling at ?
Just keep your mouth shut , and your mind on those <unk> -- I already got it .
Everything I want .
What did you wish for , honey ?
<unk> , it &apos;s me .
It &apos;s still me .
Oh my <unk> . What did you ... do to Ben ?
Baby , you &apos;re scaring me .
Don &apos;t come any closer for a sec .
This is gonna be kind of a shock ... You remember when we said &quot; together forever no matter what &quot; ?
Out front ?
You home , baby ?
I got a surprise for you .
<unk> ...
It &apos;s me .
I need you to step out front .
I don &apos;t care about rocks , I care about &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; .
You bring him back in one piece , or you can forget being Best Man .
Soon as I &apos;m back , I &apos;m gonna trade that in for a bigger rock .
Just get back soon , or I start looking for a new <unk> .
I &apos;ll be watching over you .
And you can ?
Power it up ?
He couldn &apos;t generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass .
Yet another mistake for &quot; Mr.
Fantastic . &quot;
He &lt; u &gt; also &lt; / u &gt; said we &apos;d avoid that storm in space .
And we know how that turned out .
Reed said it &apos;d be weeks till -- To help you .
I &apos;ve run every test known to man .
And they all yield the same result : &lt; u &gt; the machine is ready &lt; / u &gt; .
What do you want , Vic ?
Where do you &lt; u &gt; think &lt; / u &gt; ?
With &lt; u &gt; Sue &lt; / u &gt; .
What is this ?
Where &apos;s Reed ?
Ben , come in .
Come on .
Let me buy you something to eat .
Looks like you could use the company .
About me ?
How sweet .
I &apos;m worried about you .
What are &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; doing here ?
Victor must &apos;ve taken him .
&lt; u &gt; Where is Reed &lt; / u &gt; ?
No , it &apos;s not .
I thought I was done waiting for Reed ... We &apos;re all in this together now , Ben .
It &apos;s easy for you to be patient .
Just give Reed a little more time .
You know how he works -- <unk> every little step before he takes one -- It &apos;s not him .
It &apos;s &lt; u &gt; them &lt; / u &gt; .
I can &apos;t live like this .
He didn &apos;t mean it .
You know Johnny .
He &apos;s always been a <unk> -- &lt; u &gt; What &lt; / u &gt; did he do to the uniform ? !
Oh , he did .
I wouldn &apos;t be caught dead in that .
The suit will stretch .
You should try it -- You look like an <unk> rock band .
Well why didn &apos;t you say so ?
You want me to lift some <unk> or something ?
We need to give you a physical , so we know what got zapped .
Wouldn &apos;t want to keep Vic waiting .
I can only stay for one drink , Ben .
I &apos;ve got to meet with Victor .
Is it safe ?
We can monitor the cloud &apos;s approach and observe the tests from here .
I can handle the ship .
I can even handle Mr. <unk> <unk> .
But I don &apos;t know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits .
Who the hell came up with them ?
I &apos;ll schedule the launch .
Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew .
Way to not <unk> it .
So when do we leave ?
That &apos;s terrible news ...
But ... this disease ... is <unk> ... <unk> ...
The Center for Disease Control .
If this thing is contagious -- I wish I could tell you .
I can &apos;t pretend to know what we &apos;re dealing with here .
I &apos;ll notify the <unk> and -- What do you mean &quot; complete &quot; ?
At this rate , the infection should be complete in two , maybe three weeks -- Like the shields Reed said would protect us .
How long ?
I don &apos;t really know .
A compound <unk> <unk> .
<unk> than <unk> or carbon steel .
<unk> than diamonds -- And they &apos;re changing into ...
Your <unk> , your organs , your entire <unk> structure is changing .
Every system is still <unk> , somehow -- But all these people ... A higher calling like getting girls and making money ?
Act .
Here we go again .
Reed , what if we got these gifts for a &lt; u &gt; reason &lt; / u &gt; ?
What if we have some , you know ... like , calling ?
You need to control yourself and &lt; u &gt; think &lt; / u &gt; before you -- Right , whatever , have fun .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to <unk> .
And it &apos;s not rubber .
It &apos;s muscle , <unk> .
I seem to have the ability to <unk> the <unk> of my molecular structure and <unk> my <unk> to -- They &apos;re not costumes .
He &apos;s right .
These costumes are ... missing something .
I can &apos;t put my finger on it -- Oh , well that &apos;s easy : I &apos;m hot .
You &apos;re ... well , you &apos;re a little <unk> .
Sue &apos;s easy to see through .
And Ben &apos;s always been a <unk> .
Why aren &apos;t you writing this down ?
What ?
No .
I &apos;m trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms .
What are you trying to say ?
Just because I dress well and like to dance -- Is there something about flames ?
About <unk> , that you -- <unk> .
Okay .
<unk> bad .
Not only could you kill yourself , but you could set fire to Earth &apos;s atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it .
I can go hotter !
Back it down , Johnny !
... and figure out how to reverse them .
Let me show you to your rooms .
This place is <unk> .
You got cable ?
We should stay here until we can <unk> the extent of our changes ... Oh , it is .
Twenty ?
From outside the place looks a lot taller .
What he &apos;s trying to say is : every team needs a <unk> ... Ben <unk> is a genuine American hero who &apos;s been through a terrible <unk> You &apos;ve been working out .
This is wrong in so many ways .
Ben , are you there ?
Oh , you <unk> you .
Better not be my nurse !
Cool .
What &apos;d it do to you guys ?
The cloud has <unk> altered our DNA .
Now what is up with &lt; i &gt; that &lt; / i &gt; ?
He &apos;s not <unk> -- What about you ?
Victor &apos;s right .
Johnny , get to the command center .
Close the shields .
No : You &apos;re &lt; u &gt; ON <unk> &lt; / u &gt; !
Not this again -- You &apos;re on fire !
Last one down springs for room service .
I though we went over this .
Stay right .
Left is trouble .
Meet me at 4 : <unk> , top of the run .
That &apos;ll give you a minute to <unk> up .
My shift ends at four , but I couldn &apos;t -- I &apos;ve never felt better in my life .
When do you get off work ?
I mean , you feel a little <unk> .
So are you !
I don &apos;t know if &quot; we &apos;ve &quot; noticed , but the <unk> runs this side of the <unk> are &lt; i &gt; right outside that window &lt; / i &gt; -- And where do we think we &apos;re going ?
But Johnny ... you &lt; u &gt; can &apos;t fly &lt; / u &gt; .
Sis .
Let &lt; u &gt; me &lt; / u &gt; take care of &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; for once .
What are you doing -- No , &lt; u &gt; I &apos;m &lt; / u &gt; sorry , for pushing you out .
I &apos;m sorry , sis , for leaving you guys -- As soon as you stop &lt; u &gt; acting &lt; / u &gt; like one .
Come on , you &apos;re &lt; u &gt; smarter &lt; / u &gt; than this .
You think those people out there &lt; u &gt; care &lt; / u &gt; about you ?
You &apos;re just a &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; to them .
Look around , sis !
&lt; u &gt; She &apos;s not here &lt; / u &gt; .
So you can stop talking to me like I &apos;m your little boy -- Johnny , slow down .
&lt; u &gt; Think &lt; / u &gt; .
You know mom didn &apos;t raise us to -- At least it beats living in a lab like somebody &apos;s science project .
Is that what you call it ?
&quot; &lt; i &gt; Real &lt; / i &gt; &quot; ?
Yeah , for the last time , I hope .
I &apos;m done with this freak show .
I &apos;m moving back to the real world .
Johnny ?
Did you see Ben ?
<unk> started it !
You two need a <unk> .
You gave us &lt; u &gt; names &lt; / u &gt; ?
What are you , the &quot; face &quot; of the Fantastic Four now ?
You &apos;re gonna pay for that , <unk> .
What ? !
Dude .
That &apos;s my sister .
Uh , we call my sister the invisible girl ... the <unk> Girl .
That &apos;s the temperature of the &lt; u &gt; sun &lt; / u &gt; .
You were at <unk> <unk> .
Any hotter , you &apos;re approaching <unk> -- You &apos;re really <unk> my style here .
Is that a trick question ?
C &apos;mon , I can &apos;t be the only one who thinks this is cool .
<unk> up , Johnny .
You want to run around &lt; u &gt; on fire &lt; / u &gt; for the rest of your life ?
Wait .
You mean there &apos;s chance we could be <unk> ?
I think that thing is Ben .
What is that &lt; i &gt; thing &lt; / i &gt; ?
<unk> on , flame off .
<unk> on , flame off -- &lt; u &gt; Please &lt; / u &gt; tell me you go silent too .
Apparently I can disappear .
Keep the hot side hot , and the cool side cool !
The <unk> act as a second skin , <unk> to your individual needs to -- Top left , like you asked .
Today Wall Street .
Tomorrow , who knows ... maybe Washington .
Yes sir .
You &apos;ve got the Mayor at eight , then a <unk> interview with the <unk> -- Make sure you find Ben , bring him back here .
And keep it quiet .
I don &apos;t need this to hit the press .
&lt; u &gt; That &apos;s &lt; / u &gt; why .
Because I could have any &lt; u &gt; other &lt; / u &gt; woman ... You know , when they asked Caesar &quot; why England , &quot; he said , &quot; because it &apos;s not &lt; u &gt; mine &lt; / u &gt; . &quot;
Sir , I &apos;ve always wondered ... Why &lt; u &gt; Sue &lt; / u &gt; ?
You could have any woman in the world but -- Later .
First , I &apos;ve got some unfinished business .
A deal that needs closing ... You know , maybe you should get some rest -- And that &apos;s a &lt; u &gt; good &lt; / u &gt; thing ?
Actually , uh , people seem to think the scar &quot; <unk> &quot; you .
Get me on the AM shows , Larry King , cover of the <unk> ...
I &apos;ve &lt; u &gt; got to &lt; / u &gt; do something about this scar .
Make sure they only shoot my right side .
Sir , I &apos;m sure he wouldn &apos;t put himself -- Reed &apos;s disaster .
You know , I half- think he did this to me on purpose .
<unk> .
We &apos;re looking at low <unk> .
It &apos;s a good number , considering the <unk> from -- How &apos;s the <unk> ?
<unk> , sir .
We see you perfectly .
Leonard , how &apos;s the feed ?
History , Leonard .
&lt; u &gt; History &lt; / u &gt; .
Everything else is conversation ... How &apos;s the other matter ?
Then what is it ?
It &apos;s not just the money .
I could make money in my sleep .
Our numbers are through the roof .
The <unk> &apos;s tracking at fifty , sixty a share .
The bank &apos;s five times <unk> -- They &apos;re ready for you , sir .
Reed &apos;s &lt; u &gt; always &lt; / u &gt; right .
Good thing he doesn &apos;t always know what he &apos;s got ... And if he &apos;s not ... ?
If Reed &apos;s right , then this little trip will double our stock offering .
Which is precisely the &lt; u &gt; point &lt; / u &gt; .
<unk> is over .
It &apos;s time for &lt; u &gt; action &lt; / u &gt; .
My men could have <unk> <unk> this by now .
But I &apos;m not done with the machine -- What I &lt; u &gt; should &lt; / u &gt; have done a long time ago .
<unk> and <unk> , Reed .
This all belongs to me .
What are you doing here ?
I don &apos;t want to &lt; u &gt; understand &lt; / u &gt; it .
This isn &apos;t one of your science <unk> .
I just want to &lt; u &gt; fix &lt; / u &gt; it .
&lt; u &gt; Fast &lt; / u &gt; !
Victor , if we could understand what happened to us -- &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; ?
Reed , I put my company , my name , billions of dollars on the line , and I will &lt; u &gt; not &lt; / u &gt; let you make me look like a fool -- &lt; u &gt; I &lt; / u &gt; ruined ?
With all due respect , I told you to abort -- Didn &apos;t go as &lt; u &gt; planned &lt; / u &gt; ?
It was a &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; .
You ruined the lives of four people -- Not much .
We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage .
I &apos;m starting to wonder the same thing ... How much do you know about what happened to you ?
He &apos;s had some kind of ... reaction to exposure from the cloud .
And he &apos;s not the only one .
&lt; u &gt; Ben &lt; / u &gt; did this ?
Ben did this .
Just a little banged up .
A couple <unk> .
Why ?
It &apos;s too late for him , and soon it &apos;ll be too late for all of us .
Not until Ben is back inside !
Reed , we &apos;re running out of time .
Come on , Ben , come on ...
So reel him in .
But we came here to do a &lt; u &gt; job &lt; / u &gt; .
So let &apos;s do it .
&lt; u &gt; Quickly &lt; / u &gt; .
Ben &apos;s still out there -- Get a grip .
Reed .
We didn &apos;t come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch .
Just close the shields ... We &apos;ve got &lt; u &gt; minutes &lt; / u &gt; until it hits , not hours ... Victor , that storm &apos;s &lt; u &gt; deadly &lt; / u &gt; -- the radiation &apos;s lethal .
We need to abort .
Got it .
So take a walk , Ben ... I &apos;m going to borrow Susan for a second .
Funny how things turn out , isn &apos;t it ?
The number &apos;s &lt; u &gt; seventy-five &lt; / u &gt; .
And it &apos;s applications &lt; u &gt; and &lt; / u &gt; <unk> .
You back this mission , and I &apos;ll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or -- Not at all .
This isn &apos;t going to be a problem , is it ?
You remember in school we talked about working together .
That &apos;s what I was about to explain ...
But dreams don &apos;t pay the bills , do they ?
Same old Reed , the hopeless <unk> .
Still reaching for the stars , with the world on your back .
A &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; ?
Reed , we &apos;re at a party .
I found a broken <unk> , from space -- I &apos;m sure I can come up with something .
Sue , I need some of that anger , rage , <unk> -- You &lt; u &gt; need &lt; / u &gt; a doctor .
The power ... I need ... more power ... to control ... the storm -- Reed , stop , you need to rest your -- I can ... make it work .
That would have kinda defeated the purpose .
And Reed ...
I &apos;m saying it now .
Why didn &apos;t you say something ?
When I walked out , I waited &lt; u &gt; ten &lt; / u &gt; &lt; u &gt; minutes &lt; / u &gt; outside your door .
Ten .
Waiting for you to come find me .
I did .
I did , Reed ... but I wanted &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; to be that man .
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you ... speak his mind .
One who wasn &apos;t afraid to tell you what he wanted .
I gave him twenty .
You know , I <unk> the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late ?
Of course I was .
I &apos;d read all your papers on <unk> .
Some of them two times just so I &apos;d have something to say to you .
Remember our first date here ... ?
God , I was so nervous .
Reed .
Shh .
Just be quiet .
And look up .
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter &apos;s main power to generate enough <unk> -- &lt; u &gt; I &apos;m &lt; / u &gt; not the only one in there .
I got you , Vic , Ben , Johnny , all <unk> around in there .
Every <unk> but &lt; u &gt; yourself &lt; / u &gt; .
You don &apos;t eat , sleep .
You can &apos;t live in your head like -- Which is why I &apos;m working &lt; u &gt; twenty &lt; / u &gt; hours a day , checking every <unk> -- Better than your &lt; u &gt; life &lt; / u &gt; .
Victor &apos;s not the one who has to get into that thing .
&lt; u &gt; We &lt; / u &gt; are .
He was going to take away all my data , equipment -- Don &apos;t let Victor push you into making a mistake -- No way to know .
Without more tests , experiments .
Reed .
How close are we to a cure ?
With the right energy , we can <unk> the storm .
Maybe tie into the city grid ... And you sure you can control this thing ?
Last time didn &apos;t work out so well .
Of course .
Of course .
But &lt; u &gt; we &apos;re &lt; / u &gt; the focus , right Reed ?
&lt; u &gt; Reed &lt; / u &gt; ... ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> , not just ours .
And reverse the <unk> -- If we can build a machine to <unk> the storm , we can reverse the <unk> -- The plants , from space .
Their <unk> are still charged .
With the right amount of energy , those <unk> could &lt; u &gt; create &lt; / u &gt; the <unk> profile of the cosmic storm .
What are you doing ?
No .
There weren &apos;t .
There was &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; .
And &lt; u &gt; me &lt; / u &gt; .
No <unk> , no math .
It was actually the <unk> thing in the world .
But your head got in the way ... like it always does .
There were a lot of <unk> to consider -- I just wanted to share an apartment .
What was so complicated about that ?
I think it was a little more complicated than -- Reed .
I was ready for the next step , you weren &apos;t , <unk> , I walked .
No , I distinctly remember : &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; walked out &lt; u &gt; my &lt; / u &gt; door .
<unk> ... Are you kidding ?
I mean , &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; broke up with &lt; u &gt; me &lt; / u &gt; , right ?
What in the world would give me that idea ?
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , I didn &apos;t mean to do that ... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or -- I &apos;m sure I can come up with something .
Okay .
Is there any way to <unk> that feeling ?
Some memory or ... Anger .
Rage .
<unk> .
I &apos;m saying , if you had a little more self control , you could locate the trigger .
Can you remember the exact emotions when -- You should be able to bend light around other objects , even people , if you could control your emotional state better -- What about you ?
You haven &apos;t eaten in days .
How come you &apos;re never on this side of the <unk> ?
It &apos;s not &quot; <unk> &quot; per se .
You &apos;re bending the light around you with some kind of <unk> force field .
That &apos;s what you <unk> on the Bridge .
If it happened to him , then it could ... That &apos;s what we &apos;re here to find out .
How come Ben can &apos;t turn it on and off like us ?
Sue .
Your clothes .
Lose them .
We need to get past them .
Let &apos;s not jump to conclusions , we need a &lt; i &gt; massive amount of evidence &lt; / i &gt; before making that leap .
It has to be the cloud .
It &apos;s <unk> altered our DNA .
Sue ... &lt; i &gt; look at your hands &lt; / i &gt; .
What ?
What do you mean you -- Uh , Sue ... ?
I &lt; u &gt; can &apos;t &lt; / u &gt; .
You are such a dork , Reed ... You never got it and never will unless it &apos;s explained to you in <unk> physics .
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship -- You &apos;re &lt; u &gt; happy &lt; / u &gt; for me and Victor .
You always had a way with words .
I should be getting back .
That &apos;s good .
That &apos;s uh ... good .
Great minds think alike .
<unk> made from <unk> unstable <unk> .
I &apos;ve been working on a formula for this .
Well , he &apos;s welcome to ride shotgun , but we already have a pilot on our payroll .
You remember my brother Johnny ... As far as crew , I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission -- It &apos;s been changed .
I , uh , think I remember the number .
Right .
That &apos;s exactly what I meant .
Well , uh , based on our history ... you can handle the <unk> , and I &apos;ll focus on the molecular physics .
Or , <unk> , maybe I should take the <unk> , you work the <unk> , since you have some background in <unk> I was talking about us .
Working together .
Those solar winds are <unk> , but I <unk> them into my <unk> and -- You &apos;re , you &apos;ve , I mean , how have you <unk> Victor , we &lt; u &gt; can &apos;t do anything &lt; / u &gt; until the research is ready .
Oh , I think you already have .
Please don &apos;t make this personal -- Then why is Reed dragging his feet ?
Maybe he &lt; u &gt; likes &lt; / u &gt; having his prize specimen under glass ...
It &apos;s ironic , isn &apos;t it ?
You &apos;re finally the perfect woman for him ... because you &apos;re his &lt; u &gt; science project &lt; / u &gt; .
If these <unk> aren &apos;t stable , they could make us &lt; u &gt; worse &lt; / u &gt; , maybe even kill us .
Same old Reed .
All analysis , no action .
Wasn &apos;t that the problem with you two ?
He &apos;s working round the clock .
But the data needs to be tested , analyzed before -- Susan .
What are you doing ?
Victor , wait , slow down a second .
I want you to know I appreciate everything you &apos;ve done for me , but I just don &apos;t -- It is .
There &apos;s something we need to talk about .
Something I need to ask you ... You said it was urgent .
Please , no apologies .
I &apos;ve arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos .
You &apos;ll have <unk> clock care .
I &apos;m sorry I didn &apos;t get a chance to -- I told you , I &apos;m fine .
It &apos;s &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; I &apos;m worried about .
Victor , your scar -- Just &lt; u &gt; find &lt; / u &gt; him .
Victor , I &apos;m sorry I -- Victor , are you feeling alright ?
What &apos;s going on ?
You can &apos;t leave them out there .
<unk> the shields .
What are you doing ?
Sue , I &apos;ve lived my life <unk> of taking big steps .
And this is the biggest step yet .
If it helps , think of this as a &lt; u &gt; promotion &lt; / u &gt; .
A <unk> of sorts ... Four little words that can change our lives ...
Uh , Victor , I hope I haven &apos;t done something to make you think ...
Right , of course , the company ...
But you see , I &apos;ve come to realize all the <unk> in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with -- It &apos;s been a good two years , Victor ...
The company &apos;s accomplished so much .
Well , when you &apos;re looking at your future , it never hurts to find <unk> about the past .
I understand the &lt; i &gt; business &lt; / i &gt; reasons .
Surprised I agreed to Reed &apos;s proposal ?
I think you both know my Director of <unk> Research , Susan <unk> .
It &apos;s just business .
For your sake I hope you &apos;re right .
I &apos;m sorry if that sounds a little skeptical .
Reed &apos;s gonna fix me up -- I &apos;m just saying , I know what it &apos;s like to lose something you love .
To see it slip away , and know it &apos;s never coming back .
If you &apos;re trying to cheer me up you &apos;re doing a helluva job -- I know it can &apos;t be easy .
Life hasn &apos;t changed that much for Reed , Sue and Johnny .
At least they can go out in public .
But for you ?
People staring .
<unk> behind your back ... Well , how about <unk> ?
That can &apos;t hurt him !
I &apos;d hold that off awhile .
Now how soon can we try <unk> <unk> ?
Along the <unk> Nerve to the <unk> .
If I were in their place and I &apos;d run out of time , I &apos;d abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size ... and use the few extra minutes to get out the <unk> way possible , on my own ... What &apos;re you getting at ?
That <unk> we &apos;re picking up might only be the <unk> particle .
The <unk> may already be destroyed ... What is it ?
It means killing Benes ... And for all we know , they may have completed the operation !
Damn it to hell !
Time &apos;s up ... We &apos;ll have to take them out immediately .
I can &apos;t help it .
I &apos;m just weak , I guess .
I told you to cut down on the sugar .
Let &apos;s find what the devil &apos;s holding them up !
Contact the <unk> !
It &apos;ll be close -- but there &apos;s still a margin of safety .
Another delay ... With only forty-two minutes left .
They &apos;ll make up some time , once they get through that and reach the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> Post ...
They &apos;re in the <unk> Artery .
<unk> to <unk> .
&lt; <unk> Red Alert &gt; we &apos;re stopping the Heart .
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again .
What are the problems in stopping the Heart ?
That would give us only three seconds to <unk> him ... At <unk> ... and adjusting distance for <unk> of <unk> -- The sub should get through the Heart in <unk> seconds .
In his <unk> state ... and everything slowed down ... no more than sixty seconds .
I know that .
But what &apos;s the <unk> ?
The less time , the better .
Doctor ... without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart ?
Not until the very last second .
We must think of something ... Something to save the situation .
But it &apos;s hopeless !
They can &apos;t go back and they can &apos;t go on .
I tell you there &apos;s nothing else we can do but remove them !
We still have <unk> minutes .
Leave them in .
But we have no choice !
We &apos;ve got , to take them out !
Normally not .
Unless it &apos;s an <unk> <unk> -- That can &apos;t be -- there &apos;s no direct connection between the two -- They &apos;ve crossed over into the <unk> <unk> !
Okay to proceed .
Where do we stand ?
We understand your concern , but we &apos;ve made our decision , Doctor .
Any questions ?
Anybody ?
Benes &apos; natural <unk> .
White Corpuscles -- <unk> .
Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you &apos;ll trigger them off ... <unk> With all the unknown <unk> in the body , I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider -- Here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> Area ... Grant &apos;s <unk> qualified for this mission .
He &apos;s a <unk> <unk> and was a <unk> during the War .
Besides , he brought Benes into this country , and the <unk> people who know about him , the better .
At any rate , you &apos;ll find Grant <unk> , should anything go wrong once you &apos;re under way .
Okay , Don .
Why don &apos;t you go on .
We &apos;ll meet you at the <unk> <unk> in a few minutes .
Yes , we &apos;d like to get moving .
He &apos;s <unk> out on that one particular point .
Can &apos;t remember ? ...
What do you mean ?
Oh yes , great .
The only problem is , he can &apos;t remember what he came to tell us .
Where can I get a cab back to town ?
Just one , General ...
<unk> ?
Who -- or should I say what from ?
There &apos;ll be a team of <unk> standing by .
We &apos;re prepared to remove you immediately , should anything go wrong .
In any event , you must be out within sixty minutes .
After that , you &apos;ll be in danger of attack .
Oh yes , I &apos;ve heard of you , Doctor .
This is Dr. Duval , our Head <unk> .
Not even for a minute !
General Carter , sir , I &apos;d like you to reconsider your choice .
I &apos;m just not the right man for a mission of this kind .
It &apos;s only for an hour -- But I don &apos;t want to be <unk> -- !
Grant , our <unk> can shrink anything .
Wait a minute !
They can &apos;t shrink &lt; me &gt; !
As part of the <unk> .
You mean &lt; I &apos;m &gt; going along ?
Well , the only way to reach that <unk> is from inside the Brain .
So we &apos;ve decided to put a <unk> Team and a <unk> into a <unk> -- <unk> it way down in size , and inject it into an Artery -- <unk> ?
Where to ?
And take a little trip with them ...
They &apos;re bound to try again .
No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation .
That &apos;s right .
He wanted us to have the secret , and not them .
Which is why they tried to kill him .
I assume Benes knows how to control it .
They have ...
But we &apos;ve both got the same problem -- lack or control .
We can only keep things <unk> for exactly sixty minutes .
<unk> that , everything starts growing back to its original size .
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that ... We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap .
That &apos;s why we call it &lt; <unk> <unk> <unk> Forces &gt; .
General , I &apos;ve heard some wild ones .
But this takes it .
Say that again ?
&lt; <unk> <unk> <unk> Forces &gt; .
I don &apos;t mean to be <unk> .
But this &lt; <unk> &gt; -- for all I know it could stand for &lt; <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> &gt; ?
No question of her loyalty .
His technician okay ?
In <unk> to the Looks Department ?
Come along , they &apos;ll be operating shortly .
See you later , Mike .
I wouldn &apos;t know if he &apos;s trying to save him or kill him .
We have no choice .
Duval &apos;s the most <unk> brain surgeon in the country , and he &apos;s right here , at hand .
But why take the chance , when there must be other doctors ?
Tell him where he fits in , will you ?
I &apos;ve got a few things to check out .
Wish I knew why .
What can I do ?
Except maybe pass out ?
Cora Peterson , his Technical Assistant .
You &apos;ll join Duval and the others -- Sorry , but I &apos;m rusty on surgeons .
Who &apos;s the girl ?
Duval .
Dr. Peter Duval .
Top brain man in the country .
Ever hear of him ?
Here &apos;s the <unk> .
I can &apos;t even put a <unk> on my finger .
-- and why we need you .
Before he could breathe a word .
He &apos;s the only scientist who knows the answer to what we &apos;re after .
That &apos;s why we have to operate -- Before or after what he wanted to tell you ?
How bad off is he ?
The Other Side got to him .
Benes ... What the devil happened ?
The Pentagon , wasn &apos;t it , General ?
Only you weren &apos;t in that uniform ... Hello , Grant .
Good to see you again .
And no matter what happens , you &apos;re to take orders &lt; only &gt; from Dr. Michaels , understand ?
I &apos;ll be standing by .
&lt; I &apos;ll &gt; know .
That &apos;s no reason to suspect him of <unk> .
<unk> ?
He &apos;s impossible !
I don &apos;t agree .
Just because he &apos;s often difficult -- &#91; <unk> OF <unk> CUT OFF &#93; Glad to have you with us , Mr. Grant .
Meet Grant .
This is Dr. Michaels , Chief of the Medical Section .
Yes , there &apos;s no time to spare .
And those <unk> can be quite <unk> .
Wouldn &apos;t it be quicker if we all helped ?
No danger of attack , as long as you don &apos;t trigger them off by any injury to the System .
You &apos;re going out there ?
With those <unk> -- With no laser -- That &apos;s beside the point now .
I don &apos;t see the sense of going on .
We &apos;ll know -- in the next breath ...
But we just can &apos;t leave him in there !
What &apos;ll happen to him ?
It must have been <unk> loose during the <unk> .
I can &apos;t imagine how it possibly could have come loose .
I distinctly recall <unk> it with all four bolts -- Yes ... slowed down <unk> deal .
He certainly is .
He should be up and about in no time .
He &apos;s making a fine recovery .
I don &apos;t know yet , Doctor .
And I won &apos;t know until I test it .
Cora , is something wrong with the laser ?
No danger of an <unk> .
At our reduced scale , they &apos;re much too minute to prove fatal to Benes .
Air <unk> ! ...
Doctor -- Dr. Michaels is right .
We have no choice .
Doctor ... you can &apos;t mean that !
Not when we &apos;ve come this far .
And if we give up , there &apos;ll be no way of saving Mr. Benes -- But big enough for us ...
Yes , a <unk> too small to show up on the X-rays .
They &apos;re much smaller than <unk> ... Never saw &lt; that &gt; .
Not even under an <unk> .
Thank you for <unk> .
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along .
What is it ?
Anything wrong ?
I -- I want to say ... Look !
They follow the direction of her glance , are startled to see : We better get back to the sub .
Every second counts now .
Well , if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly <unk> your point of view .
What do you mean ?
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through .
Oh , no .
Plenty of cause .
He won &apos;t follow the herd , or change his <unk> -- even when they &apos;re not popular .
And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days , there &apos;s nothing more suspicious than that .
Under a cloud without cause , I take it .
You &apos;re not the first , but he &apos;s much too innocent , much too involved with his work , to realize what &apos;s going on around him .
As obvious as that ?
Our Security people will jump for joy .
I suppose Duval &apos;s onto me , too ?
That &apos;s why you &apos;re really here .
I knew it from the start .
What gives you that idea ?
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval ... A great deal more than that , I believe ... That &apos;s what they pay me for .
Thank you for saving my life .
I feel much better now ... No need to get up -- I can &apos;t till the hatch is <unk> !
Open it !
Open it before they get here !
I &apos;ve got a source .
All I have to do is tap it .
Oh yes , I &apos;m sure Dr. Duval could .
If we had the parts .
A surgeon might ... No , it requires such absolute <unk> -- If you had a <unk> about this size and power <unk> , and a thin enough wire -- -- could you piece it together ?
Not anything built into the <unk> .
If it hadn &apos;t come loose -- You must carry spare parts -- You can &apos;t --it &apos;s too dangerous -- I &apos;ll try to hold it from the other side of the wall , while you push from out here .
Maybe that &apos;ll do it .
Not now .
We need air , not <unk> !
Shouldn &apos;t you answer that ?
I have no idea .
Then how come it worked loose ?
But I did .
I &apos;m positive !
Looks like you didn &apos;t <unk> it down too well .
Doctor -- is it possible ?
That we &apos;re seeing it happen before our eyes ?
Look at that ... they &apos;re changing color ... And if it should take more time to get through -- -- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock .
I always thought it was nothing but red .
I never ... never imagined it could be anything ... like this .
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval -- A long time , with one man .
I &apos;ve been with him since I got out of school .
He brought me into the <unk> , over five years ago .
I understand you &apos;ve been Dr. Duval &apos;s Assistant for quite some time ...
He must &apos;ve <unk> you out of the <unk> .
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval .
The beam of this laser can be <unk> to one <unk> of a <unk> .
That could be quite a lethal weapon ...
It could kill , not cure .
Now I know ... That &apos;ll teach you where to keep your hand .
You may learn to like it .
That &apos;s the trouble .
I am .
Being shrunk ...
I think it &apos;s the most exciting -- We &apos;re going to see things no one ever saw before .
The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a <unk> ... Just think of it -- Well , it &apos;s not exactly a pleasure <unk> .
You sound as if you &apos;re not looking forward to it .
I &apos;ll take some <unk> <unk> , ma &apos;am .
We &apos;re pushing oxygen today .
Bet you &apos;re pretty handy around the house ... Can you cook ?
I &apos;m going to do what I can to save Benes .
Dr. Duval , you are not going through with this !
I absolutely forbid it !
I &apos;m responsible for the lives of everyone here !
I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship !
We have no alternative .
With only six minutes left , we &apos;ll just barely make it .
<unk> Point ?
What &apos;re you talking about !
The <unk> of God ... You left something out .
--and certain chemicals involving proteins -- Take a close look at your Soul , and your <unk> , and your God out there -- The Soul ?
The <unk> mind cannot <unk> <unk> .
And the Soul which comes from God is <unk> .
I know only too well what &apos;s in the balance , Doctor .
And it &apos;s not my ego , damned or otherwise .
As usual , you want everything your way .
Except this time there &apos;s more than your damned ego at stake .
I &apos;ll do nothing of the sort !
The operation is &lt; my &gt; responsibility !
I won &apos;t do it , and that &apos;s final !
Dr. <unk> I insist you test the laser .
If it won &apos;t work , it &apos;s beyond my power to fix it .
But if it does , there &apos;s no telling how long it will hold up .
It &apos;s a jury rig , at best , and we &apos;ll need every second of use we can get out of it .
That &apos;s why I don &apos;t want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests .
All I &apos;m asking is you test it <unk> !
I &apos;ve done all I could with the laser .
Better <unk> ? !
To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late ?
It &apos;s against my better <unk> ...
If we can go in past the <unk> Nerve ... That puts us right here ...
Which means we can head straight for the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Nothing -- against all that force .
What can we do ?
You can &apos;t believe all that &apos;s <unk> ?
That there isn &apos;t a <unk> Intelligence at work -- Nothing <unk> about it .
Just an interchange of <unk> .
The end product of five hundred million years of <unk> .
Captain -- head in the <unk> of the flow and drift with it .
We can &apos;t take a second more .
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery .
Captain -- something must be wrong with your <unk> !
But that isn &apos;t possible .
That &apos;s not the purpose of this mission .
Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you &apos;re in the clear .
I don &apos;t agree .
I think we ought to stop and take a sample .
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins .
It &apos;s too late now .
We must go on .
I can &apos;t breathe ! ...
I &apos;ve got to get out !
Doctor , what &apos;s wrong ?
It &apos;s too late !
What about Dr. Michaels ?
You said there was a quick way out !
We could follow the <unk> Nerve to the corner of the <unk> .
The ship &apos;s good as finished .
We &apos;ll have to get out on our own !
Is there a quick way out ?
It I can clear this Central Nerve , that &lt; may &gt; be enough ...
Doctor , we &apos;ve just about had it .
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key <unk> ... How does it look , Doctor ?
&quot; <unk> in <unk> glory The <unk> Mind of Man ... &quot; &quot; Yet all the <unk> that light the <unk> of the Universe shine dim , Before the <unk> of a <unk> Thought -- &quot; Then why not take it ?
Yes ... We can transfer over to the Inner <unk> , and go by way of the <unk> <unk> .
Isn &apos;t there another route ?
So we can <unk> all this ?
We &apos;ll never get there in time , at this rate .
No , there &apos;s no other way .
Isn &apos;t there another surgical procedure you can try ?
Maybe we can ... Skipper , is there a <unk> on this sub ?
Just a few cells away from a <unk> air chamber -- one of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> -- and we can &apos;t get enough to fill a microscopic tank .
Don &apos;t tell me they &apos;re <unk> ... A simple exchange , Mr. Grant .
Corpuscles <unk> carbon <unk> -- the moment they touch the Wall of the <unk> -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side .
Mind letting me in on what &apos;s going on out there ?
They all lead to the same place -- the <unk> .
I &apos;d hate to get lost on that <unk> ... Quite a piece of plumbing .
Only to the naked eye .
Those <unk> -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color .
But the rest of the <unk> &apos;s very much like sea water .
An ocean of life ... Everything can be <unk> in half , no matter how minute .
You mean Inner Space is endless ?
The <unk> <unk> were right ... &lt; Man &gt; is the center of the Universe ... We stand in the middle of <unk> , between <unk> and Inner Space .
And there &apos;s no limit to either .
Why not ?
Because of his gibberish about <unk> and the Soul ?
<unk> -- that &apos;s all it is -- to blind the <unk> like you !
And to hide his real identity -- a <unk> whose only purpose is to kill Benes !
And you made it possible !
I don &apos;t believe that .
Nothing has changed as far as &lt; my &gt; authority goes !
He is &lt; not &gt; going to operate !
Not in the little time we have left !
There &apos;s no chance of success !
It &apos;s <unk> suicide for all of us !
Sorry , but the situation has changed .
I &apos;m in charge of this mission !
You were <unk> to take orders from me , not give them !
How long will it take to get from here to the <unk> Point ?
Once time &apos;s up , <unk> begins .
In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System .
Then White Corpuscles will <unk> to destroy it , as they would any <unk> .
Hold it , Skipper .
What happens if we <unk> ?
No , we should reach the base of the Brain shortly .
And from there , it &apos;s not far to the site of the injury .
Looks like quite a way to go ... Let &apos;s hope they realize the danger .
Captain , I &apos;ll give you a new <unk> heading .
They &apos;re tracking us <unk> .
Once they see where we &apos;re going , I &apos;m sure they &apos;ll take every precaution .
Just what it is .
<unk> , destroying <unk> -- or any other foreign <unk> that <unk> the System .
Looks like somebody declared war .
<unk> <unk> .
We ought to be clear of them soon .
Skipper , you &apos;re picking up <unk> -- or whatever it is .
The <unk> System <unk> off <unk> fluid from the <unk> .
Without it , we &apos;d all swell up like balloons .
He reaches the console , begins to take out a new <unk> .
I always had an idea there was only one System .
The <unk> .
We &apos;re entering the <unk> System .
Those are <unk> of cells , <unk> a <unk> .
It &apos;s possible -- Two in a row ?
I can &apos;t believe it .
Whatever happened was an accident .
You still never know what &apos;s going on in anyone &apos;s mind ...
I -- I don &apos;t know what to say .
I know he &apos;s under a cloud , but there &apos;s not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession .
That line was <unk> with ... You have no right to blame Duval -- I saw the laser just before we started .
It was <unk> down <unk> .
You don &apos;t suppose what happened was an &apos; accident ? &apos;
Any more than my safety line <unk> after it was tied off to the sub ?
<unk> ?
I don &apos;t understand ... Let &apos;s hope ...
So far , somebody &apos;s tried to sabotage this mission twice .
His <unk> &apos;s in fine condition .
It should be clear <unk> through this area .
<unk> ?
If he can kick up a storm by just &lt; breathing &gt; -- We &apos;re safe -- long as it remains that color ... We &apos;re in the <unk> <unk> .
It keeps the <unk> from <unk> against the Wall of the <unk> up there .
When those <unk> become <unk> , we wind up with <unk> -- and a <unk> <unk> .
Looks like the sea , at dawn .
Send the following message ... Well , sir ?
Which is it ?
The <unk> , or Benes &apos; life ?
They &apos;ll still be able to track us by radar , because of the <unk> fuel .
But that &apos;ll knock out our communications !
We &apos;ll be cutting ourselves off from the outside .
Just one little <unk> and a circuit wire is all it takes .
Grant -- wait a minute -- you &apos;re not going to <unk> the <unk> ?
Walt for the <unk> -- between the time he <unk> and <unk> .
All right now -- push the <unk> through as soon as I get inside .
There &apos;s no other way .
Tie my safety line to the sub .
Yes -- with all that pressure , and <unk> within -- Well , we better get on with it .
In a way -- yes .
Those are <unk> <unk> in the <unk> after a lifetime of &apos; <unk> . &apos;
<unk> from smoke and <unk> -- <unk> of dust -- If those Corpuscles can take on air , no reason why we can &apos;t .
All we have to do is hook up the <unk> to that air chamber you were <unk> about , and when Benes <unk> , there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank .
How &apos;s that sound to you , Skipper ?
At this size , I would certainly think so .
<unk> yourselves in .
There should be a tremendous <unk> when the Heart starts up again .
There it is !
It <unk> down quite a <unk> in a lifetime .
Forty million beats .
Sounds like heavy <unk> ... Request <unk> , Mr. Grant .
If there &apos;s any chance -- Tell them to take us out .
I &apos;m afraid there &apos;s only one thing we can do .
Call off the mission .
That &apos;s just <unk> .
We can &apos;t go forward -- and we can &apos;t go back .
Yes ... We can go forward on this course , but it means going directly through the Heart .
If we can &apos;t go back , is there an <unk> route ?
A forced joining of an Artery and <unk> .
Must &apos;ve happened when Benes was hurt .
Well , it seems to me if you <unk> a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we &apos;d take quite a beating .
About forty miles an hour .
How are you , Miss Peterson ?
Miss Peterson , his Technical Assistant .
<unk> assassination ? !
But that means you suspect -- They know they failed to kill Benes .
Security thinks they &apos;ll try again , first chance they get .
We &apos;re afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination .
At an operation ?
We need you for Security purposes , Mr. Grant .
And she said it was <unk> ... What &apos;d you do that for ?
I can &apos;t tell you that either ...
Excuse me , Mr. Grant , but you &apos;ve got a <unk> on your <unk> .
Where we going ?
I can &apos;t tell you .
I thought I was on my vacation ... What &apos;s it all about ?
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour , Mr. Grant .
Nothing wrong with us !
Not a thing !
We &apos;re fine -- just fine !
Oh -- sure , sure !
Never better !
We feel great , don &apos;t we ?
Just &lt; great &gt; ? !
Uh -- what ?
Who , me ?
Oh , no !
Don &apos;t bother about me !
We &apos;re not hurt !
Isn &apos;t that right , Skipper ?
We can get out through the <unk> Section .
Come on -- it &apos;s no use !
<unk> nothing .
He &apos;s the one who &apos;s been <unk> the mission ... Get this on .
Hurry !
Dr. Michaels ...
He went berserk ...
Remember -- we can &apos;t take more than five minutes to get out .
I &apos;ve come up against <unk> before , and Duval just doesn &apos;t fit the pattern .
I &apos;m going out there , Skipper .
Maybe I can be of some help ...
Enough to breathe , but that &apos;s all .
Any reserve air ?
<unk> , please .
And <unk> yourselves in .
<unk> for <unk> &apos; ...
Remind me to ask you about the love life of an <unk> .
<unk> for <unk> Research -- the <unk> <unk> of Deep <unk> <unk> .
All in all , quite a <unk> ...
It should work -- theoretically .
If it doesn &apos;t , the mission &apos;s off .
The <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
Except for your <unk> .
That &apos;s cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit .
They can &apos;t <unk> nuclear fuel .
But once the <unk> &apos;s <unk> -- along with the <unk> -- a microscopic particle should <unk> enough energy to <unk> it .
If it &apos;s no military secret , how can a sub run on a microscopic particle ?
Nothing you could see with the naked eye .
But there &apos;s a microscopic <unk> particle inside .
That makes two of us .
Out of your element , aren &apos;t you , Captain ?
I could use a <unk> ... How &apos;s it look ?
What I was afraid would happen .
The stuff we passed through -- that looked like <unk> -- What &apos;s wrong , Skipper ?
Look at those Walls up ahead !
<unk> minutes left ...
But chances are we won &apos;t have to wait that long for <unk> three .
Could I run a tube through that Wall , without <unk> Benes ?
Yes , there is .
We &apos;re losing pressure in the <unk> <unk> .
Check the <unk> , right over there .
What is it , Skipper ?
Yes , by all means .
We must try it .
It &apos;s a dangerous procedure .
If I miss the timing , we could explode the tanks ...
But I &apos;m willing to try it .
Not to the <unk> .
But we &apos;ve lost too much air to make it the rest of the way .
Was there any damage ?
Well , that takes care of the <unk> .
It was probably caused by that electric shock .
I &apos;ll guide you , once we &apos;re in the Heart .
I &apos;ll never find my way through that .
Looks simple to operate .
On the <unk> .
Captain , how will you be able to follow my charts -- <unk> up there ?
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we &apos;re not going through it .
Once in the <unk> Artery , we &apos;ll remain in the <unk> System ... until we reach the point of damage -- -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the <unk> with a laser beam .
After the operation , we &apos;ll return by way of the <unk> System -- -- until we reach the base of the neck -- -- where we &apos;ll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic .
Even so , because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we &apos;ll still be cruising mighty fast .
We &apos;ll be smashed to bits if there &apos;s any turbulence -- <unk> is <unk> through .
Better come down and have a look !
What do you mean ?
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape <unk> ...
It &apos;s less than one <unk> of an inch thick .
And <unk> .
The Wall &apos;s <unk> ... We &apos;re entering a <unk> .
<unk> in the middle .
Doctor -- the channel &apos;s getting awful narrow .
I &apos;ll do what I can .
Then don &apos;t drift down further .
We could never fight that current it &apos;s physically impossible .
May I have your ticket , please ?
<unk> ma <unk> <unk> !
Well , see , there &apos;s a minimum charge of four dollars .
<unk> parking charges by the day .
I just pulled in here .
I just fucking pulled in here !
I &apos;m sorry , sir , we do have to charge you the four dollars .
I decided not to - I &apos;m , uh , not taking the trip as it turns out .
You , uh ...
I &apos;m sorry , sir , but - Yeah , I just came in .
I decided not to park here .
... What do you mean , you decided not to park here ?
<unk> ... oh , geez ... ... Is this a fucking joke ?
Is this a fucking joke here ?
No Jean , no money !
Drop that fucking money !
Where &apos;s my damn daughter ?
No Jean , no money !
Fuck you , man !
Where &apos;s Jerry ?
I gave <unk> FUCKING <unk> - Where &apos;s my daughter ?
I am through fucking around !
Drop that fucking briefcase !
I got your goddamn money , you little punk .
Now where &apos;s my daughter ?
Who the fuck are you ?
Who the fuck are you ?
That &apos;s my license and <unk> .
I wanna be in <unk> .
What &apos;s this , sir ?
... So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that , right here in Brainerd .
Can I see your license and <unk> please ?
You &apos;re required to display temporary <unk> , either in the plate area or taped inside the back window .
It certainly is , officer .
Still got that smell !
This is a new car , then , sir ?
... What &apos;re you talking about ?
Ya find the work interesting , do ya ?
I don &apos;t know .
Few <unk> .

So , uh , how long have you been with the escort service ?
Yeah , well , it depends on the artist .
You know , Jose <unk> , ya got no complaints .
Waiter !

A deal &apos;s a deal !
Blood has been shed .

I &apos;m coming into town tomorrow .
Have the money ready .
Oh , for Chrissakes here - Look .

The price is now the whole amount .
We want the entire eighty thousand .
Well , I &apos;m sorry , but I just - I - DON &apos;T EVER <unk> ME , JERRY !
JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP !
This was s &apos;posed to be a <unk> <unk> deal - We need more - The heck d &apos;ya mean ?

That &apos;s right .
And we need more money .
Three people .
In Brainerd .
What the heck d &apos;ya mean ?

Blood has been shed , Jerry .
What the heck &apos;re you talkin &apos; about ?
Let &apos;s just finish up this deal here - Oh , Jean &apos;s okay .
But there &apos;s three people up in Brainerd who aren &apos;t so okay , I &apos;ll tell ya that .
My wife !
What the - how &apos;s - Okay , Jerry .
You &apos;re <unk> us to perform this mission , but you , you won &apos;t , uh , you won &apos;t - <unk> , fuck it , let &apos;s take a look at that Ciera .
Yah .
<unk> matters that needn &apos;t , uh - Well , it &apos;s all just part of this - they don &apos;t know I need it , see .
Okay , so there &apos;s that .
And even if they did , I wouldn &apos;t get it .
So there &apos;s that on top , then .
See , these &apos;re personal matters .
So why don &apos;t you just ask him for the money ?
Well , that &apos;s , that &apos;s , I &apos;m not go <unk> , <unk> - see , I just need money .
Now , her dad &apos;s real wealthy - What kind of trouble are you in , Jerry ?
Okay , it &apos;s - see , it &apos;s not me payin &apos; the ransom .
The thing is , my wife , she &apos;s wealthy - her dad , he &apos;s real well off .
Now , I &apos;m in a bit of trouble - ... <unk> point is , you pay the <unk> what eighty thousand bucks ?
- I mean , you give us half the ransom , forty thousand , you keep half .
It &apos;s like robbing Peter to play Paul , it doesn &apos;t make any - You want your own wife kidnapped ?
Oh , no , it &apos;s real sound .
It &apos;s all worked out .
I &apos;m not gonna sit here and debate .
I will say this though : what Shep told us didn &apos;t make a whole lot of sense .
I &apos;m not gonna debate you , Jerry .
Yah .
But it &apos;s not a whole <unk> advance deal .
I give you a <unk> vehicle in advance and - Yeah , you already said that .
Yah , well , that was a <unk> , then .
Except that you were gonna be here at 7 : 30 .
Well , okay , it &apos;s - Shep didn &apos;t tell us much , Jerry .
Yah , but the deal was , the car first , see , then the forty thousand , like as if it was the ransom .
I thought Shep told you - The new vehicle , plus forty thousand dollars .
No , that &apos;s not it , Jerry .
... So I guess that &apos;s it , then .
Here &apos;s the keys - Yah , you don &apos;t need that .
Now were you thinking of financing here ?
You oughta be aware a this <unk> plan they have now , it &apos;s really super - Yah , I don &apos;t need no <unk> though .
Yah , ya got yer , this loaded here , this has yer independent , uh , yer slipped <unk> , uh , yer <unk> <unk> steering , yer alarm and radar , and I can give it to ya with a heck of a <unk> , this TruCoat stuff , it &apos;ll keep the salt off - Oh , for Christ &apos;s sake , where &apos;s my goddamn checkbook .
Let &apos;s get this over with .
One hunnert &apos;s the best we can do here .
One hundred !
You lied to me , Mr. Lundegaard .
You &apos;re a <unk> liar !
Well , he never done this before , but seein &apos; as it &apos;s special circumstances and all , he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat .
Well , okay , I &apos;ll talk to my boss ... You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it !
Ready to make delivery , ya says !
Come on down and get it !
And here ya are and you &apos;re <unk> &apos; my time and you &apos;re <unk> &apos; my wife &apos;s time and I &apos;m payin &apos; <unk> five for this vehicle here !
Okay , I &apos;m not sayin &apos; I didn &apos;t - We had us a deal here for <unk> five .
You sat there and darned if you didn &apos;t tell me you &apos;d get this car , these options , <unk> THE <unk> , for <unk> !
Yah , but this TruCoat - You &apos;re sittin &apos; here , you &apos;re talkin &apos; in <unk> !
You &apos;re talkin &apos; like we didn &apos;t go over this already !
Yah , but I &apos;m sayin &apos; , that TruCoat , you don &apos;t get it and you get <unk> problems .
It &apos;ll cost you a heck of lot more &apos;n five hunnert - I sat right here and said I didn &apos;t want no TruCoat !
Yah , but that TruCoat - We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this !
Oh , don &apos;t be silly .
Well , okay - thank you , Detective .
Oh , don &apos;t be silly .
Oh , no , I can &apos;t let you do that .
Both of these .
Where &apos;d you get him that <unk> ?
Yah , he - Oh , he &apos;s adorable .
He &apos;s three now .
Course , not in that picture .
Oh , now he &apos;s adorable .
I thought you &apos;d never ask .
The older one is Janet , she &apos;s nine , and the younger one is <unk> .
You have children ?
They can really take over , that &apos;s for sure .
Oh , yah , I know that !
That &apos;s wonderful .
<unk> .
It &apos;ll change your life , a course .
This &apos;ll be our first .
We &apos;ve been waiting a long time .
End a April .
Ah , well , we haven &apos;t had to run around like you .
When &apos;re you due ?
Ya got that right .
Yah , got a front movin &apos; in .
Oh sure .
They say she &apos;s gonna turn cold tomorrow .
Okay , well , thanks a bunch , Mr. <unk> .
You &apos;re right , it &apos;s probably nothin &apos; , but thanks for callin &apos; her in .
Just a general way .
Uh-huh - in what way ?
Oh , he was a little guy , kinda <unk> lookin &apos; .
What &apos;d this guy look like anyways ?
So , ya know , he &apos;s drinkin &apos; , so I don &apos;t think a whole great deal of it , but Mrs. <unk> heard about the <unk> out here and she thought I should call it in , so I called it in .
End a story .
Well , <unk> &amp; <unk> &apos;s , that &apos;s closer ta Moose Lake , so I made that assumption .
White Bear Lake ?
And he says , &apos; Yah , that guy &apos;s dead and I don &apos;t mean a old age . &apos;
And then he says , &apos; Geez , I &apos;m goin &apos; crazy out there at the lake . &apos;
Ya got that right .
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now .
So I don &apos;t say nothin &apos; and he says , &apos; What do ya think about that ? &apos;
So I says , &apos; Well , that don &apos;t sound like too good a deal for him then . &apos;
So he says , &apos; So I get it , so you think I &apos;m some kinda jerk for askin &apos; , &apos; only he doesn &apos;t use the word jerk .
... So , I &apos;m <unk> &apos; bar there at <unk> &amp; <unk> &apos;s last Tuesday and this little guy &apos;s drinkin &apos; and he says , &apos; So where can a guy find some action - I &apos;m goin &apos; crazy down there at the lake . &apos;
And I says , &apos; What kinda action ? &apos;
and he says , &apos; Woman action , what do I look like , &apos; And I says &apos; Well , what do I look like , I don &apos;t arrange that kinda thing , &apos; and he says , &apos; I &apos;m goin &apos; crazy out there at the lake &apos; and I says , &apos; Well , this ain &apos;t that kinda place . &apos;
How ya doin &apos; ?
Oh , yah ?
Twin Cities ?
... Yah , okay , I think I &apos;ll drive down there , then .
Shep Proudfoot .
That &apos;s a name .
Uh-huh ... A what ?
First one &apos;s a <unk> company , second one &apos;s a private <unk> .
A Shep Proudfoot .
The numbers y <unk> for , calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox .
Two to <unk> that night .
No , I gotta - hey , Norm , I thought you were goin &apos; fishin &apos; up at <unk> <unk> ?
Pretty darn good , ya want some ?
Hiya , Norm .
How ya doin &apos; , Margie ?
How &apos;s the <unk> ?
They said they were goin &apos; to the Twin Cities ?
And what about the other fella ?
No .
Like I say , he was funny-looking .
More &apos;n most people even .
Is there anything else you can tell me about him ?
So you were having sex with the little fella , then ?
Was he funny-looking apart from that ?
I couldn &apos;t really say .
He wasn &apos;t <unk> .
Can you be any more specific ?
I dunno .
Just funny-looking .
In what way ?
Well , the little guy , he was kinda funny-looking .
Where you girls from ?
Yah , that can happen .
A <unk> thing .
Yah .
Maybe I &apos;m sayin &apos; that cause he smoked Marlboros .
He was a little older .
<unk> like the <unk> man .
Okay , I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like .
<unk> .
But I went to high school in White Bear Lake .
... What &apos;s the big deal ?
It &apos;s an hour - Okay .
Well , that &apos;s why we don &apos;t want ya goin &apos; out fer hockey .
You know what a <unk> is ?
And yet you &apos;re gettin &apos; C grades .
It &apos;s this <unk> there that concerns your dad and me .
You &apos;re not a C student .
I &apos;m talkin &apos; about your potential .
No , no .
See - they , no , see , they only deal with me .
Ya feel this , this <unk> on the phone there , they &apos;re very - these guys &apos;re dangerous - Wade &apos;s got a point there .

Yah , geez , Scotty .
I &apos;ll go talk to him .
Okay .
And Scotty , is he gonna be all right ?
Ya know , they said no one listenin &apos; in , they &apos;ll be watchin &apos; , ya know .
Maybe it &apos;s all bull , but like you said , Stan , they &apos;re callin &apos; the shots .
No , I - they don &apos;t want - they &apos;re just s &apos;posed to be dealin &apos; with me , they were real clear .
Okay .
We &apos;ll get the money together .
Don &apos;t worry about it , Jerry .
Now , d &apos;you want anyone at home , with you , until they call ?
They &apos;re gonna call , give me instructions for a drop .
I &apos;m supposed to have the money ready tomorrow .
What &apos;s the next step here , Jerry ?
We &apos;re not <unk> here , Wade , we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing .
Jerry , we &apos;re not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
No , see , I don &apos;t need a finder &apos;s fee , I need - finder &apos;s fee &apos;s , what , ten percent , heck that &apos;s not gonna do it for me .
I need the principal .
You &apos;re sayin &apos; - what &apos;re you sayin &apos; ?
Yah , right - Jerry - we thought you were bringin &apos; us an investment .
... My fee ?
Wade , what the heck &apos;re you talkin &apos; about ?
The <unk> are pretty thorough , so the only thing we don &apos;t know is your fee .
Oh , those numbers are all right , <unk> .
Good to see ya again , Jerry .
If these numbers are right , this looks pretty sweet .
They &apos;re playin &apos; the <unk> !
You wouldn &apos;t have an extra ticket there ?
So you &apos;re goin &apos; to the <unk> on Sunday ?
We &apos;re gonna get Mom back for ya , but we gotta play ball .
Ya know , that &apos;s the deal .
Now if <unk> calls , or Sylvia , you just say that Mom is in Florida with <unk> and Marty ... Yeah , but - No !
We can &apos;t let anyone know about this thing !
We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman , he &apos;ll tell ya the same thing !
Dad , I really think we should call the cops .
No , no , nothin &apos;s goin &apos; wrong here .
<unk> and I , we &apos;re - we &apos;re makin &apos; sure this gets handled right .
What if - what if <unk> goes wrong ?
It &apos;s okay , Scotty .
They &apos;re not gonna want to hurt her any .
These men , they just want money , see .
Dad !
What &apos;re they doing ?
Wuddya think they &apos;re doin &apos; with Mom ?
... How ya doin &apos; there , Scotty ?
Look , Dad , there is no fucking way - I &apos;m sorry , sir , I - ... If it &apos;s so damned important to ya !
Sure right now !
You &apos;re darned <unk> &apos; !
Sir ?
Right now ?
Okay , I &apos;ll do a damned lot count !
I &apos;m not , uh , I &apos;m not <unk> &apos; here .
I &apos;m cooperating ...
There &apos;s no , uh - we &apos;re doin &apos; all we can ... Sir , you have no call to get <unk> with me .
I &apos;m just doin &apos; my job here .
Ma &apos;am , I answered your question .
I answered the darn - I &apos;m cooperating here , and I ... ...
I &apos;m sorry , sir ?
Ma &apos;am , I answered your question .
I know , but - well , how do you establish that , sir ?
Are the cars , uh , counted daily or what kind of - We run a pretty tight ship here .
Yah , but - Well , I would know .
I &apos;m the Executive <unk> Manager .
but do you know that for sure without - The car &apos;s not from our lot , ma &apos;am .
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently ?
Yah , I see .
Okay , are you sure , cause , I mean , how do you know ?
Because , see , the crime I &apos;m investigating , the <unk> were driving a car with dealer plates .
And they called someone who works here , so it &apos;d be quite a coincidence if they weren &apos;t , ya know , connected .
Yah , like I told ya , we haven &apos;t had any vehicles go missing .
Yah , it &apos;s this vehicle I asked you about yesterday .
I was just wondering - No , I - I unnerstand .
I &apos;ll keep it real short , then .
I &apos;m on my way out of town , but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down ?
I &apos;m carrying a bit of a load here .
Yah , no , I &apos;m kinda - I &apos;m kinda busy - <unk> , thanks a bunch .
I &apos;ll let you get back to your paperwork , then .
No .
No , ma &apos;am .
Yah , ya know we &apos;ve got the big statue there .
So you haven &apos;t had any vehicles go missing , then ?
... Babe the Blue Ox ?
Yah .
Yah .
Home a Paul <unk> and Babe the Blue Ox .
Uh-huh .
Well , I &apos;m a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some <unk> and I was just wondering if you &apos;ve had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - <unk> a tan <unk> Ciera ?

I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re aware ... your front door -- it seems someone <unk> <unk> into the lock , then tapped it with a <unk> to shatter the cylinder .
This is Detective <unk> with the <unk> unit .
We have some new information about the &quot; incident &quot; at your condo .
You want to see pain ?
<unk> by First <unk> Tuesday nights .
See the guys with testicular cancer .
That &apos;s pain .
I &apos;m in pain .
You need healthy , natural sleep .
<unk> <unk> root and get some more exercise .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Can &apos;t you give me something ?
You need to lighten up .
Maybe I died already .
Look at my face .
No , you can &apos;t die of <unk> .
I did , I think .
But , I &apos;m okay ...
I &apos;m fine ... Who did this to you ?
My God , you &apos;re shot ... What happened ... ?
Yes , fine .
Just , get on .
Stay away a couple of weeks , at least .
I &apos;m not paying this back .
I consider it &quot; asshole tax . &quot;
I can &apos;t let myself see where you &apos;re going .
Go wherever it takes you , remember ... keep away from major cities ... Why are you doing this ?
I &apos;m begging you .
Get on the bus .
Get on the bus .
Okay , if that &apos;s what it takes , you &apos;ll never have to see me again .
Here ... here ... Leave me alone !
I don &apos;t ever want to see you again !
Do this for me , Marla .
Do this for me , if you never do anything else ... Let go of me !
What ? !
You &apos;re sorry ?
I don &apos;t believe that for a minute .
I &apos;m sorry , but I ...
There &apos;s a part of you I really like , but I can &apos;t do this anymore .
I just can &apos;t .
This is killing me ... No , no , shut up !
I &apos;ve had enough .
I tried , Tyler ...
I have tried ... You are an insane person .
You have to get out of here .
Leave as soon as possible .
Go to any <unk> town , away from any major city ...
I &apos;m trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but , I think your life might be in real danger .
Whatever .
I &apos;ll take my food to go ...
I mean , the depth and <unk> of our relationship has only recently been <unk> for me .
I know this ...
I know us hasn &apos;t been such a great thing for you ...
I deserve that .
Anyway , I &apos;ve ...
I &apos;ve only just realized Two sides ?
You &apos;re Dr. <unk> and Mr. <unk> .
I know that I &apos;ve been ... <unk> .
I know it &apos;s been like there &apos;s two sides to me .
You got about thirty seconds .
Then , I &apos;ll have the <unk> <unk> ... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate <unk> pie .
Because ...
I &apos;m Tyler Durden .
I &apos;ve done you enough favors .
Absolutely , you have every right .
I need you to do me a favor .
<unk> seconds , then I &apos;m out of here .
Give me a minute , Marla , alright ... just sixty seconds .
I don &apos;t want to hear anything you &apos;ve got to say .
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit .
Marla ...
I need to talk to you .
It &apos;s going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out .
The were burning their fingertips with <unk> .
The stink was unbelievable .
I &apos;m sorry , I ...
Your <unk> , bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom .
I thought they were going to break my arm .
Marla , no , wait ... Tyler Durden !
Tyler Durden , you fucking freak .
What &apos;s going on ?
I &apos;m coming over there ... Say my name !
What &apos;s my name ! ?
Say my name .
What is wrong with you ?
What did you say ... ?
We &apos;ve just lost cabin pressure .
You fuck me , then <unk> me .
You love me , you hate me .
You show me your sensitive side , then you turn into a total asshole !
Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship , Tyler ?
Answer the question !
Is that what you &apos;re calling it ?
We did make love ?
You mean , you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love ?
Will you just answer me , for <unk> ? !
Is this a trick ?
Because the answer &apos;s &quot; yes &quot; or because the answer &apos;s &quot; no ? &quot;
What kind of stupid question is that ? !
Marla , it &apos;s me .
Have we ... have we ever had sex ?
He &apos;s not here !
Tyler &apos;s not here anymore !
He &apos;s gone away !
He &apos;s not here .
Can I come in ?
The <unk> Street <unk> Company .
You &apos;re afraid to say .
Let go of me ... Leave me alone .
Why would you get bent if I asked ?
Why would you ask if it &apos;s a guy or a girl ? !
Guy or girl ?
... A person .
What is this ?
Who did this ?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor ... what was going on there ?
Have we been talking too long ?
Must we change the subject ?
That ... <unk> and <unk> .
You hear that ?
What do you get out of it ?
I don &apos;t understand .
Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person ... to hang onto ?
It was the smart move on her part .
I don &apos;t know .
Do you care ?
Really ...
I mean it .
Have you been going to your groups ?
You ... don &apos;t have to ... leave .
Well ... thanks , anyway .
Uh ... <unk> .
I could check your <unk> .
I think everything &apos;s okay here .
I wish I could return the favor .
No ... no problem .
Well , that &apos;s a relief .
Thank you .
You feel nothing ?
Okay .
Okay , I &apos;m sure .
<unk> , they &apos;re dead .
I &apos;m alive and I &apos;m in <unk> .
You want any ?
This is a sweet side of you .
Picking these up for ... &quot; Mrs. <unk> &quot; and ... &quot; Mrs.
<unk> . &quot;
Where are they ?
She didn &apos;t call Tyler .
I &apos;m <unk> in her book .
I don &apos;t know ... Would you do something for me ?
I need you to check and see if there &apos;s a <unk> in my breast .
I can &apos;t afford to throw money away on a doctor .
What are you talking about ?
You &apos;re such a <unk> , I can &apos;t even begin to keep up .
Don &apos;t worry , I &apos;m leaving .
It &apos;s time for you to leave .
It suits you .
Like sex crime victims , underwear <unk> , bound with electrical tape .
Worth every penny .
I got this dress at a <unk> store for one dollar .
Except for their <unk> , Tyler and Marla were never in the same room .
What the hell are you doing here ?
What are you doing here ?
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death ?
So you &apos;re staying in tonight ?
This could go on for hours .
This isn &apos;t a <unk> suicide thing .
This is probably one of those <unk> help things .
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment .
Me too .
I got a stomach full of <unk> .
I took what was left of a bottle .
Might &apos;ve been too much .
I &apos;m just on my way out ...
I &apos;ve been going to <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
You want to see some truly fucked up people ?
Look , this is a bad time ... Like testicular cancer ?
It &apos;s for men .
I found a new one .
You haven &apos;t been going to yours .
That &apos;s the idea -- we split them .
The <unk> number .
I haven &apos;t seen you at any support groups .
How did you find me ?
Where have you been the last few weeks ?
In case we want to switch nights .
Um ... Marla , should we maybe exchange numbers ?
Let &apos;s not make a big thing out of it .
Looks like this is goodbye .
We &apos;ll split it .
You get it the first and third Sunday of the month .
That &apos;s your favorite , too ?
Tried to slip it by me , eh ?
The girl had done her homework .
So , we each have three -- that &apos;s six .
What about the seventh day ?
I want <unk> <unk> cancer .
Then , take blood parasites .
It &apos;s yours .
Now we each have three .
So far , you have four and I only have two !
You can &apos;t have the whole brain !
I want that .
Okay .
I &apos;ll take blood parasites and organic brain <unk> -- I want brain parasites .
You can &apos;t have both parasites .
You can take blood parasites -- I &apos;ll take the parasites .
I don &apos;t know -- am I ?
Well , <unk> , I have more of a right to be there than you .
You still have your balls .
I think testicular cancer should be no contest .
You take <unk> .
My smoking doesn &apos;t go over at all .
We &apos;ll split up the week .
You can have <unk> , <unk> and -- Please .
Can &apos;t we do something ... ?
<unk> a cancer ward .
It &apos;s not my problem .
Look , I can &apos;t cry with a <unk> present .
It becomes an addiction .
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak .
I ...
I don &apos;t know .
I guess ... when people think you &apos;re dying , they really listen , instead ...
Anyone who might &apos;ve noticed either died or recovered and never came back .
A year ?
How &apos;d you manage that ?
These are my groups .
I was here first .
I &apos;ve been coming for a year .
It &apos;s cheaper than a movie , and there &apos;s free coffee .
Why are you doing this ?
Go ahead .
I &apos;ll expose you .
I &apos;ll expose you .
Telling me off .
Is it going as well as you hoped ... ?
&quot; ... Mr.
Taylor . &quot;
And I saw you practicing this ...
Okay , in the Sylvia <unk> philosophy way , we &apos;re all dying .
But you &apos;re not dying the way <unk> is dying .
I &apos;m on to you .
You &apos;re a <unk> .
You aren &apos;t dying .
We need to talk .
You fucking slut ! !
... and you come home to this .
Well ... let me see ... here &apos;s the thing ...
I <unk> you .
I never pick up my phone .
What &apos;s up ?
I just called a second ago .
There was no answer .
I &apos;m at a <unk> .
Uh ...
I &apos;m sorry .
We met on the plane .
We had the same briefcase .
I &apos;m ... you know , the clever guy .
Please return your <unk> to their full upright and locked position .
You &apos;re the one who did this to me .
You &apos;re Mr. Durden , sir .
Tyler Durden .
Is this part of the test ?
Who do you think I am ?
You were standing right where you are now , asking how good our security is .
It &apos;s tight as a drum .
You were in here last Thursday night .
Yes ... it &apos;s a test .
Is this a test , sir ?
... You know me ?
How have you been ?
Yeah , uh huh ... yeah ?
Oh ...
I had everything in that bag .
My <unk>
shirts ... my <unk>
shoes ... Nine time out of ten , it &apos;s an electric razor .
But , every once in a while ... ... it &apos;s a dildo .
It &apos;s airline policy not to imply <unk> in the event of a dildo .
We use the <unk> <unk> : &quot; A dildo . &quot;
Never &quot; Your dildo . &quot;
My suitcase was <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> .
But when a suitcase <unk> , the <unk> have to call the police .
Excuse me ?
&quot; <unk> ? &quot;
<unk> don &apos;t worry about ticking .
Modern bombs don &apos;t <unk> .
You &apos;re a <unk> .
I saw you at <unk> , <unk> and testicular cancer .
Tell the other person how you feel .
Now , find your power animal .
If I did have a <unk> , I &apos;d name it Marla .
Marla ... the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop <unk> it , but you can &apos;t .
-- But , in here , in everyone , there &apos;s the <unk> of a <unk> headache .
Yet they forced themselves to be positive .
They never said &quot; parasite ; &quot; they said &quot; agent . &quot;
They always talked about getting better .
... And you open the door and you step inside .
We &apos;re inside our hearts .
Now , <unk> your pain as a white ball of healing light .
That &apos;s right , the pain itself is a ball of healing light .
I wasn &apos;t really dying , I wasn &apos;t host to cancer or parasites ; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around .
Tonight , we &apos;re going to open the green door -- the heart <unk> ... My eyes are open .
Look at me ... Do something for me .
It &apos;s the only way to get rid of you ... Why are you going with this , <unk> boy ?
Not my mouth .
Our mouth .
Why do you want to do that ?
Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth ?
What have you left for me ?
What are you doing ?
You will .
You know you will .
I swear on my life , I won &apos;t ...
If I leave , you will be right back where I found you ...
Please understand ...
I &apos;ve gotten all I can from this , Tyler .
I &apos;m doing this for us .
Why are you doing this ? !
No more running off without you .
From here on out , we do it together .
... no , no , no ... From now on , we &apos;ll share Marla .
We &apos;ve been spending too much time apart ... Look , I can be selfish , I know that .
I &apos;m not blind to my own <unk> ... No , no , I don &apos;t .
I thank you , I really do .
Thank you , but I don &apos;t need you anymore .
You need me .
Why can &apos;t I get rid of you ?
Why can &apos;t I just wish you away ?
Why ... why ... why ... ?
Fuck that , maybe you &apos;re my <unk> .
How &apos;d you do that ? !
You &apos;re a fucking <unk> of my imagination ... you &apos;re <unk> <unk> state ...
<unk> with remote detonation .
Do we have to do everything ourselves ? !
Not exactly according to plan .
Damn it !
<unk> it ... <unk> .
Your merry band mixed the nitro with <unk> .
I saw it floating in the bomb .
What the fuck -- ?
Fifteen seconds now .
Can you see alright ?
10 ... 9 ... 8 ....
It &apos;s out of our hands .
This is it .
Can &apos;t you call it off ... ?
i ... <unk> .... <unk> .. <unk> .... <unk> ...
This is the beginning .
We &apos;re at ground zero .
Maybe you should say a few words , to mark the occasion .
I think this is about where we came in .
<unk> the bomb ?
<unk> the bomb , please .
Ask me nicely .
<unk> the bomb .
Not an option , for the most obvious of reasons .
You need to get with the program .
Seven minutes .
Let &apos;s get out of here .
You want out ?
Fuck your struggle .
I want out .
Bob was a grown man .
In any great struggle , there will be casualties .
Wouldn &apos;t that be <unk> in the name ?
Project &quot; Mayhem . &quot;
Bob is dead , Tyler .
The police blew a hole in his head .
Was that part of your plan ?
I &apos;ve got everything .
The bombs .
The army .
I &apos;ve got Marla .
I &apos;m serious .
That &apos;s the wrong one .
Don &apos;t pull the green wire .
Pull anything but the green wire .
Green ?
Did you say green ?
I &apos;m pulling the green wire .
This is not about <unk> .
If I &apos;m wrong , we &apos;re both dead ..
If you know , I know .
I wouldn &apos;t be doing that .
Unless you know which wires , in what order ... You don &apos;t know that .
There could still be people inside .
The buildings were <unk> thirty minutes ago .
Everything &apos;s <unk> exactly as planned .
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder ?
What are you doing running through the streets in your <unk> ?
We both use that body .
... your <unk> !
They &apos;re our <unk> .
Get your mind around that .
... to let this happen !
I &apos;m not going ...
I &apos;m going to ... ... go through with this ?
What are you going to do ?
I can &apos;t let you ... What a ridiculous thing to say .
You ... you can &apos;t be serious about this .
You could be standing under <unk> stories of steel and concrete with a <unk> gallons of <unk> strapped to the support ... oh , maybe it couldn &apos;t be ... Um , well ... <unk> , no .
She &apos;s ... you ... you &apos;re fucking her .
What about Marla ?
What about Marla ?
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping .
You have jobs .
The house is rented in your name .
You took me to the house .
What about them ?
They &apos;re lunatics .
Wrong , wrong -- what about the car crash ... the two guys in the <unk> ?
You never talked to me in front of anyone else .
No !
This isn &apos;t true .
We ... we were around other people , together , both of us ...
It &apos;s okay .
We okay ... a little <unk> , sure , but ... What ... what are you saying ?
We &apos;re going to have to do something about Marla ...
This isn &apos;t possible ...
There !
Happy ?
I asked for one thing from you ... one simple promise .
Now look what you &apos;ve done !
But , when you fall asleep , I do things without you ... Oh , yeah .
I didn &apos;t really know my Dad ... You can see me and hear me , but no one else can ...
He &apos;s not here !
Tyler &apos;s not here anymore !
He &apos;s gone away !
And , sometimes you control it ...
The first rule of fight club is -- you don &apos;t talk about fight club .
Sometimes I control it , and you imagine yourself watching me ... What are you talking about ... ?
Is this really news to you ?
People think that you &apos;re me , because you and I happen to share the same body .
I don &apos;t know !
Tell me !
Why do people think anything ?
Answer me , Tyler .
Why did you do that ?
Why do people think I &apos;m Tyler Durden ?
You broke your promise .
You talked to her about me .
Why do people think I &apos;m you ?
And , we &apos;re definitely filling a void in the <unk> South .
What &apos;s this all about , Tyler ?
Four in Milwaukee .
If the <unk> waits at the door for three days without food , shelter or <unk> , then he can enter and begin training .
If the <unk> is young , we tell him he &apos;s too young .
Old , too old .
Fat , too fat .
Wait a minute ... You &apos;re too young .
Sorry .
... is over .
... is over .
What are you talking about ?
<unk> bottom isn &apos;t a weekend <unk> !
It &apos;s not a <unk> !
You have to forget everything you know , everything you think you know -- about life , about friendship , about you and me .
Why do you think I blew up your condo ?
Fuck my life .
Fuck fight club .
Fuck you and fuck Marla .
I &apos;m sick of this .
How &apos;s that ?
I want to hear the truth .
I would feel nothing about my life ?
Is that what you want to hear ? !
If you died right now , how would you feel about your life ?
I don &apos;t know !
Nothing !
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s true .
You &apos;re asking questions that don &apos;t have answers .
You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else .
I &apos;m not asking you to .
You choose your level of involvement .
I won &apos;t make decisions for you .
What the hell ...
?
!
We are the <unk> , <unk> crap of the world .
We are all part of the same compost <unk> ... What are you doing ? !
This does not belong to us .
We are not the leaders .
We are not special .
What do you want to know about Project Mayhem ?
I want to know -- Should I <unk> you ?
Should I put this on your &quot; action item list ? &quot;
What do you want ?
A statement of purpose ... ?
You know what I mean .
Is this a <unk> club ?
Is it about you and me ?
Fight club was the beginning .
Now it &apos;s out of the <unk> and there &apos;s a name for it -- Project Mayhem .
Why wasn &apos;t I involved from the beginning ?
You and I started fight club together .
What should I have told you ?
Why wasn &apos;t I told about &quot; Project Mayhem ? &quot;
Something on your mind ?
I felt like destroying something beautiful .
Where did you go , <unk> ?
Imagine how he feels .
I feel sick .
I asked you what you studied .
An <unk> community college student ID card .
What did you used to study , Raymond K. <unk> ?
What is it ?
What are we doing ?
I thought you did .
<unk> ?
Did you start that one ?
Local 8 just started in <unk> <unk> .
And , Bob said he was at fight club in <unk> last week .
I heard .
Local 15 , Monday nights .
There &apos;s fight club in <unk> City .
Okay , and ... and ... Six months advance pay .
Six months !
Nothing .
Do what you like .
Work .
Going to work .
Yeah .
Where you headed ?
No thanks , I quit .
Fuck <unk> .
Fuck <unk> .
We are God &apos;s unwanted children , with no special place and no special attention , and so be it .
... Marla ... ?
We don &apos;t ... ?
We don &apos;t need him ...
It isn &apos;t ... ?
Listen to me .
You have to consider the possibility that God doesn &apos;t like you , he never wanted you .
In all probability , He hates you .
This is not the worst thing that can happen ...
I don &apos;t know ...
Shut up .
Our fathers were our models for God .
And , if our fathers <unk> , what does that tell us about God ?
No , I &apos;m not ...
This is the greatest moment of your life and you &apos;re off somewhere , missing it .
No , what you &apos;re feeling is <unk> enlightenment .
I ...
I think I understand .
I think I get it ...
I was going to my cave to find my power animal .
Stop it .
This is your pain -- your burning hand .
It &apos;s right here .
Look at it .
<unk> meditation worked for cancer , it could work for this .
Look at your hand .
Tyler &apos;s kiss was a <unk> on the back of my hand .
This clear layer in <unk> .
We &apos;ll mix it back in when we make the soap .
Hard to imagine you in Boy <unk> .
As the fat <unk> , the <unk> floats to the surface .
Remember the crap they taught you in Boy <unk> .
A <unk> clinic .
What is this place ?
Don &apos;t mention me .
You get rid of her .
<unk> !
I don &apos;t know what to make of this , sir , I really don &apos;t ... &quot; The <unk> who destroyed my property has <unk> my <unk> of <unk> . &quot;
You want to finish her off ?
That was three times you promised .
I said I promise !
Yes , I promise .
Promise you won &apos;t .
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house , to her or anyone -- I will find out .
And you &apos;ll never see me again .
Promise me .
You &apos;ve gotta understand something about me .
I have a little rule , okay ?
Don &apos;t ever talk to her about me .
Ever .
I can &apos;t stand that kind of shit .
Listen ... do me a favor ... sit here a minute ... She &apos;d <unk> my support groups , now she &apos;s invading my home .
She needs an <unk> .
This isn &apos;t love .
This is <unk> .
Marla doesn &apos;t need a lover .
She needs a case worker .
Hey ... don &apos;t knock librarians .
Oh , and my <unk> is more librarians .
She is a wild , twisted bitch .
Stay away from that one .
You &apos;re okay with this ?
Good .
This chick was up on the table with her legs in the <unk> before the doctor even walked in the room .
The things that she said ...
I &apos;ve never heard a woman talk like that ... Yeah , I &apos;m sure .
No .
Not at all .
I mean , this girl ... uh , you &apos;re not into her or anything ... ?
He was obviously able to handle it .
<unk> Lincoln .
Big reach .
<unk> guys fight till they &apos;re burger .
Any <unk> figure .
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and <unk> your <unk> .
<unk> .
William <unk> .
<unk> or dead ?
If you could fight any celebrity ?
A guy came to fight club for the first time , his ass was a wad of cookie <unk> .
After a few weeks , he was carved out of wood .
Soldier of <unk> .
Business <unk> .
New <unk> .
What are you reading ?
&quot; I get cancer , and I kill Joe . &quot;
&quot; I am Joe &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
It &apos;s written in first person .
&quot; Without me , Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells . &quot;
There &apos;s a whole series -- &quot; I am Joe &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
Oh , a new riot control grenade ... &quot; ... the successful combination of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of ... blah , blah , blah ... &quot; The previous <unk> had been a bit of a <unk> .
I don &apos;t know how Tyler found the house , but he &apos;d been there for half a year .
Where &apos;s your car ?
A <unk> of men raised by women .
I &apos;m wondering if another woman is the answer we really need .
After I graduated , I called him long distance and asked , &quot; Now what ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Get a job . &quot;
When I turned twenty-five , I called him and asked , &quot; Now what ? &quot;
He said , &quot; I don &apos;t know .
Get married . &quot;
I know that .
He was setting up <unk> .
My father never went to college , so it was really important that I go .
Oh , yeah .
I didn &apos;t know my dad .
Well , I knew him , till I was six .
He went and married another woman , had more kids .
Every six years or so he &apos;d do it again -- new city , new family .
My dad .
No question .
My boss , probably .
Who would you fight ?
If you could fight anyone ... one on one , whoever you wanted , who would you fight ?
This fight , pussy .
Call what off ?
We &apos;ve crossed the <unk> .
You want to call it off ?
But a good strange .
How do you feel ?
Like hell .
That counted .
Shit .
Sorry .
That didn &apos;t count .
Where do you want it ?
In the face ?
Alright , go crazy .
Let &apos; er rip .
This is crazy .
Why not you ?
I &apos;m letting you go first .
Do it .
I don &apos;t want to die without any scars .
How much can you really know about yourself if you &apos;ve never been in a fight ?
Come on ... you &apos;re the only person I &apos;ve ever asked .
No .
That &apos;s a good thing , isn &apos;t it ?
I don &apos;t know , either .
I want to find out .
I &apos;ve never been hit , have you ?
I don &apos;t know about this .
You get the idea .
Go ahead .
Say it .
He <unk> on <unk> ; he <unk> on <unk> <unk> ; and , with creme of <unk> soup , well ... ... Oh , yeah .
Oh , yeah .
Don &apos;t watch .
I can &apos;t if you watch .
He was the <unk> terrorist of the food service industry .
Only a <unk> could have caught Tyler at work .
A nice , big cock .
No one really knows that they &apos;ve seen it .
But they did .
<unk> of a second .
That &apos;s how long it &apos;s up there .
In reel three , right after the <unk> dog and the <unk> <unk> -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can , there &apos;s the flash of Tyler &apos;s contribution ... -- Like <unk> single frames from adult movies into family films .
It <unk> him other interesting opportunities .
Why would anyone want this shitty job ?
It &apos;s called a &quot; <unk> . &quot;
The movie goes on , and nobody in the audience has any idea .
They &apos;re called &quot; cigarette burns . &quot;
I want you to hit me as hard as you can .
I want you to hit me as hard as you can .
You &apos;re welcome .
But , I want you to do me one favor .
Yes , you can .
Can I stay at your place ?
Is it a problem for you to ask ?
Would that be a problem ?
Why don &apos;t you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place ?
You called me so you could have a place to stay .
We &apos;re on our third pitcher of beer .
Just ask me .
I don &apos;t follow ...
So , you called me up , because you just wanted to have a drink before you ... go find a hotel ?
God , it &apos;s late .
I should find a hotel ... Do what you like .
The things you own , they end up <unk> you .
Well , I have to file a claim ...
This time maybe get a <unk> TV .
You &apos;ll be occupied for weeks .
I don &apos;t ... think so .
The &quot; now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again &quot; list .
That list .
Oh , yeah , you gotta start making the list .
Insurance &apos;ll cover it .
Delivered from bullshit colors like &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Delivered from <unk> <unk> .
Delivered from <unk> in <unk> green <unk> patterns .
Delivered from Swedish furniture .
But maybe , just maybe , you &apos;ve been delivered .
I mean , you did lose a lot of nice , neat little shit .
The trendy paper <unk> , the <unk> <unk> unit , am I right ?
... no ... no ...
I don &apos;t know , maybe I &apos;m wrong .
Maybe it &apos;s a terrible tragedy .
There &apos;s always that .
Could be worse .
A woman could cut off your penis while you &apos;re asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car .
And , now it &apos;s gone .
I guess so .
This is how we fill up our lives .
You buy furniture .
You tell yourself : this is the last sofa I &apos;ll ever need .
No matter what else happens , I &apos;ve got the sofa issue handled .
Then , the right set of dishes .
The right <unk> .
Keep it up , then .
Keep it right up .
Well , uh ... great .
How &apos;s that working out for you ?
The <unk> .
I get it .
You &apos;re very clever .
You see , when you travel , everything is small , <unk> Why ?
So you can say , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s what you do . &quot;
-- And be a <unk> little shit about it ?
I mean -- for a living .
What do you want me to do ?
What do you do , Tyler ?
<unk> gets you high .
In a <unk> emergency , we &apos;re taking giant , panicked breaths ... No , supply oxygen ?
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes ?
This is how I met -- Two , equal parts gasoline and diet <unk> .
Three , dissolve <unk> in gasoline until the <unk> is thick .
Somehow , I realize all of this -- the gun , the bombs , the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer .
Look what we &apos;ve <unk> .
Thirty seconds .
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction .
The <unk> Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with <unk> <unk> .
In two minutes , primary charges will blow base charges , and those buildings will be reduced to <unk> rubble .
I know this because Tyler knows this .
That old saying , how you always hurt the one you love , well , it works both way .
It &apos;s getting exciting now .
... i ... <unk> .... <unk> .. <unk> .... <unk> ... One minute .
This is the beginning .
We &apos;re at ground zero .
Maybe you should say a few words , to mark the occasion .
Well , sir , you said you might .
Did I tell you I &apos;d call you a fascist <unk> ? !
You told me you &apos;d say that , too .
<unk> the plan .
You told me you &apos;d say that .
Now wait , there &apos;s been a <unk> .
Everything &apos;s changed ... Don &apos;t worry about us , sir .
We &apos;re solid .
Very good , Sir .
Listen , something is going to happen , something terrible ... Who is this ?
His name is Robert <unk> !
Robert <unk> is dead .
He &apos;s dead , because of you ... No !
Wrong !
This man &apos;s name is Robert <unk> .
But , in Project Mayhem , we have no names .
No , no .
This is a man -- this man has a name ...
But , this is Project Mayhem .
What he wanted ?
Look ... look at him .
Look at him !
What does he want ?
This is a person .
This is not a <unk> in your machine ...
It &apos;s what he would have wanted , sir .
Let go of me ! !
Thank you .
Thank you , sir ... Alright , Christ !
Fucking let me go !
We need some towels , Lou .
We need replacement light <unk> .
Okay !
Okay , fuck it !
Use the basement !
Get off me !
What are you doing ? !
You and your friend .
Did you hear what I just said ? !
You &apos;re welcome to join our club .
Look , stupid fuck , I want everyone outta here now !
Yes , it is .
Ain &apos;t that something ?
It &apos;s free to all .
There is no money .
He don &apos;t own this place , I do .
How much money &apos;s he getting for this ?
<unk> ?
<unk> &apos;s at home with a broken <unk> .
We have a deal worked out with <unk> .
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place ?
No , please , no , God , no !
Would you rather be dead ?
Too much school .
Stuff .
That means you have to get more <unk> .
Yeah ... animals and <unk> --- What did you want to be , Raymond K. <unk> ?
I ...
I don &apos;t know ...
&quot; Stuff . &quot;
Were the <unk> hard ?
Please , God , no ...
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor <unk> to dig up your dental records , because there won &apos;t be much left of your face .
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad ?
They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers .
Raymond , you &apos;re going to die .
How &apos;d you know ?
Raymond K. <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , apartment A.
A small , <unk> basement apartment .
I have to save Eugene !
No !
It can &apos;t be .
I was dead .
And came back to life .
An <unk> machine .
Where &apos;s Eugene ?
What did you see ?
Yeah , fuck &apos; em .
No offense .
What do you want me to do ?
Yes .
I was in a hospital .
There was screaming ... A nurse was <unk> me .
I couldn &apos;t tell what she looked like , but the name tag was right in my face .
<unk> .
No , it &apos;s not here .
This one was different .
More like the pile up and the van going into the lake .
What did you see ?
What am I looking for ?
I don &apos;t think so .
Alex &apos;s <unk> happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it .
This makes no sense .
Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake .
Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested ?
And when it was <unk> &apos;s turn to die , and Thomas was in the way ?
Six <unk> in a row .
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn ?
Are you crazy ?
What makes you think you &apos;d survive ?
No .
If anyone dies from a crash now , it &apos;ll be me .
But I can &apos;t die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive .
I &apos;m last on Death &apos;s list .
What are you doing ?
You &apos;re going to kill us !
How you doing in there , hero ?
What about that ?
So let &apos;s do it .
So if you give us the pregnant lady &apos;s number , we can warn her about the lake and she &apos;ll live long enough to have the baby .
Please , what else could it mean ?
Then it wasn &apos;t just a sign .
It was a premonition ?
I can practically taste the water in my throat .
And something else .
The smell of flowers ... You were there ?
I was driving a white van .
It must &apos;ve gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned .
It was ... horrible .
You have to tell us now .
I hope you &apos;re ready for this .
The second one just dies .
A 16 year old kid .
How can you say that ?
What kind of monster are you ?
I didn &apos;t beat it ; I hid from it .
If you were smart you &apos;d put a down payment on a <unk> plot and say goodbye to the dog , because what little life you have left is over as you know it .
Don &apos;t make new friends , don &apos;t fall in love , and don &apos;t ever bother trying to save others .
That &apos;s the worst killer of them all .
That &apos;s what Alex used to ask himself right up until ...
The songs on the radio .
But wait .
I don &apos;t understand .
Why is this even happening to me ?
If you have the same power as Alex , you &apos;ll be seeing signs soon .
When you see anything creepy or <unk> , an <unk> irony kinda thing ?
Don &apos;t ignore it .
It usually means the difference between life and death .
That &apos;s good .
Get all your tears out now , you &apos;ll need your eyes .
For the signs .
That still doesn &apos;t make sense .
You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to .
But <unk> <unk> died last in my premonition , not first .
<unk> .
That makes you last to go .
But don &apos;t worry , once the others are dead , it &apos;ll come back for you .
Always does .
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends .
<unk> order ?
Then I &apos;m next !
I was meant to die with my friends , so I &apos;m next !
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash .
That was Death &apos;s original design .
Death &apos;s list .
The precise order you &apos;re going to die in .
Well , if you put them on the list , they &apos;re already tits up .
It &apos;s not just about me .
Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident .
What if the others are in danger , too ?
Nice work .
Maybe if you &apos;re real lucky , you &apos;ll wind up in here with me .
But I doubt you &apos;ll survive that long .
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up ...
I saved some people .
And now I think Death is after me .
I thought ... I thought you might be able to help me .
Kimberly <unk> , eh ?
What do you want ?
She had the baby ?
Don &apos;t sweat it .
It &apos;s over .
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene .
If only Alex and I had done that with the others , Alex might still be ... Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can .
We need to hurry .
Here we go .
The vehicle &apos;s a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella <unk> .
And Christ , there &apos;s almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two .
<unk> care of .
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight .
Holy shit .
He said &quot; only new life can defeat death . &quot;
If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born , a brand new soul that was never part of Death &apos;s <unk> ...
Remember the <unk> ?
There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van .
He probably already knows we &apos;re coming .
Should we knock ?
A <unk> .
He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us .
That &apos;s why Death is working backwards .
It &apos;s tying up all the loose ends , <unk> the <unk> once and for all This chapter of the screenplay <unk> scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie .
In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay , it has not been <unk> .
So if you never got off the plane , none of us would be alive in the first place .
Being alive after our time caused an <unk> <unk> - a <unk> in Death &apos;s design .
I &apos;m not sure I understand .
Your entire world view just went out the window .
I couldn &apos;t expect a religious conversation overnight .
We &apos;ll get through this .
I promise .
Um , Clear ?
I &apos;m sorry ... about before .
I ... What , you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago ?
You &apos;re nuts .
Jury duty ?
That &apos;s randomly selected by social security numbers .
What about you , Kimberly ?
Did you anyone from <unk> ?
<unk> me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours .
&apos;Course , missed the show ...
I had tickets to go , but one day I &apos;m in Paris , <unk> &apos; on acid , <unk> &apos; <unk> an &apos; such , and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign .
What about the rest of you ?
Kimberly , you were driving to <unk> .
Was Route 18 your first choice ?
That lucky bastard .
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the <unk> and had to collect the <unk> .
Blow me .
Yellow means go , Kimmy .
<unk> , shouldn &apos;t we stop and help your mother ?
Blow me .
Yellow means go , Kimberly .
<unk> , shouldn &apos;t we stop and help your mother ?
Yeah .
Who does he think he is ?
Knight <unk> ?
A <unk> Am .
That shit went out with New Kids on the <unk> .
Yeah , you should have <unk> .
Calm down , Kimmy .
It &apos;s not drugs , just weed .
<unk> , shouldn &apos;t we go back and help your mother ?
<unk> <unk> &apos;s dead .
Guess he wasn &apos;t as lucky as we thought .
Good .
Cause we just got some new info and I don &apos;t need you getting <unk> on me .
You &apos;ve made your point .
I thought we were finished with this bullshit .
This is police work , not the psychic Hot Line .
Look , you weren &apos;t there .
It was weird .
She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident , she knew .
Never mind .
Of course not .
That would be irresponsible and <unk> .
Tell me you didn &apos;t start up on that Flight 180 shit again .
Did you ?
Do you want to deliver this baby ?
I &apos;ve got to stop and help those people .
Please .
It &apos;s not going to wait .
Take my van !
Damn , they always stick me with the <unk> .
Jorge .
When I get out of here I &apos;m going to sue his cheating ass off .
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning .
What do you mean &quot; grand theft auto ? &quot;
This is insane .
Does she have a cell phone ?
A way we can contact her ?
Take a guess .
What was the fight about ?
We had a fight .
Some things got broken , the dog went crazy , she left me .
Wouldn &apos;t say where she was going .
No .
What &apos;s this about ?
May we come in ?
Maybe .
What &apos;s this about ?
Are you Jorge <unk> ?
I &apos;m Officer Burke .
I &apos;m looking for an Isabella <unk> .
I never mad it .
The <unk> bus I was on <unk> some chick all over the road and we had to stop .
Yeah , so what happened ?
I got that beat .
So like , last May , I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in <unk> .
There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests <unk> during the night .
But why single me out ?
What am I in the great scheme of things ?
You &apos;d think I stepped off Flight 180 or something ... Fucking weird , man .
Here &apos;s what I don &apos;t get .
For nine months , Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up ...
Anyway , I guessed it right and won these .
Eighteen .
And it &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; .
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident .
They asked me what number means &quot; good luck &quot; in Jewish .
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you &apos;ll live .
This can &apos;t be happening .
My career &apos;s at a peak , I finally met a cute guy , I just bought a new house ... Yeah , I hate to love and leave ya , but I &apos;ve been over this <unk> shit since the sixth season .
First I &apos;m stuck with Jury <unk> , now this nonsense .
Yeah , don &apos;t make me <unk> you for harassment .
For God &apos;s sake , leave him alone , Dad .
I know .
I can feel it too .
Welcome back .
We did it .
For real .
That &apos;s crazy .
You can &apos;t give up now .
We can still fight this thing .
You can &apos;t cheat destiny .
I know what I have to do to save us .
I have to die .
Then what &apos;s the premonition of the lake supposed to mean ?
I &apos;m not sure ...
I don &apos;t think Isabella was ever <unk> to die in the <unk> up .
Impossible .
She was on the <unk> .
I don &apos;t ... what if I made a mistake ?
But it &apos;s over .
Isabella &apos;s baby was the key .
You saw her die and everything , right ?
I know how it feels to be dead .
Are you okay ?
You just face planted !
No time .
Keep going .
I wouldn &apos;t know how to explain any of this anyway .
Shouldn &apos;t we pull over ?
I think a nurse named <unk> is going to choke Isabella to death !
I wasn &apos;t worried about us .
Don &apos;t worry .
Nothing can happen to us .
Um , Kimberly ?
This is a neighborhood .
You may wanna slow it down .
He can &apos;t breathe damn it .
I think his lung &apos;s <unk> !
Stop it , don &apos;t move him !
You said she was going to drive into a lake .
How can she when she &apos;s in protective custody ?
How do you know ?
Guys , let &apos;s not panic .
Isabella &apos;s safe .
Are you thinking what I &apos;m thinking ?
Whoa , nine months ?
Hey , I &apos;m a police officer , remember ?
How are we going to find her ?
There must be thousands of white <unk> in this state .
Shit , I don &apos;t have her number .
She was never interviewed .
She took off right after the accident .
It sounds all well and good , but what if we &apos;re wrong ?
It throws the entire Death list out of whack .
And a new list has to be <unk> from scratch .
We all start over with a clean slate .
Yeah , I thought he was supposed to be helpful .
New life <unk> death ?
Follow the signs ?
Where the hell did you find that guy ?
Who is this guy , anyway ?
This is <unk> .
I did .
And right now , I don &apos;t think she cares .
We have to tell her she &apos;s in danger !
Nora &apos;s not coming .
She refuses to leave her son .
Turn around .
The cleaning woman said they &apos;re at the dentist &apos;s .
<unk> and Main .
They &apos;re next on the list .
We have to find them .
I &apos;m not following you -- <unk> ...
It &apos;s a sign !
If Clear &apos;s right about the order , then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by <unk> !
Clean up ?
I don &apos;t ...
I didn &apos;t .
Until I was <unk> to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors .
Then you believe all this ? ?
That Death is working off a list ?
I know .
I &apos;ve gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the <unk> .
We &apos;re all meeting at my apartment tonight .
<unk> <unk> &apos;s dead .
I tried calling last night but your father -- ... My <unk> was just like his .
You mean Alex Browning .
<unk> about accidents .
Kids yelling &quot; pile up &quot; for no reason .
It all felt ... just wrong .
Just like ...
The log truck ... and everybody I guess .
Everyone was driving like a maniac .
And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen , even before it did .
Do you remember what <unk> it all ?
Like I said , it was like I was there .
I remember everything .
The sounds of the crashes , the smells , the look on <unk> &apos;s face ... Tell me again how it started .
You &apos;re not listening to me !
You have to do something !
Alright miss , calm down .
I just need this lane open .
I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder !
THAT &apos;s the truck that &apos;s going to kill everyone !
There &apos;s going to be a pile up .
<unk> .
<unk> everywhere .
I saw it happen .
It happened .
What &apos;s going on here ?
For Christ sakes girl , take a breath .
Highway to Hell , Highway to Hell .
Relax , you need to chill the fuck out .
There &apos;s going to be a huge accident !
Everyone &apos;s gonna die , all of us , I saw it !
What is it ?
What are you ?
There &apos;s going to be a huge accident !
Everyone &apos;s gonna die .
All of us !
I saw it !
What is it ?
What are you ?
How does a nice mature fuck sound ?
What &apos;s the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to <unk> ?
I can live with <unk> -- Get ready to smile , five guys per girl .
This trip better be worth it .
What &apos;s the <unk> ratio again ?
No , I &apos;m good .
Want me to drive ?
Would you take these ?
And if I die ... Could you throw all my drugs out ?
<unk> , porno , you know ...
Anything that would break my mom &apos;s heart .
I guess so .
And you &apos;re gonna die after me , right ?
I ... I don &apos;t know .
When I die .
Is it gonna hurt ?
Can I ask you a question ?
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s <unk> , the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance .
The best way to get to Yankee <unk> is Route 18 .
Hey , don &apos;t be <unk> &apos; the <unk> .
More than that .
All the songs on the radio were about car crashes .
Some kid &apos;s banging toy cars together .
She was dialing her cell phone with her <unk> on .
His car was <unk> oil all over the road .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d do if I lost you .
I used to have those feelings , too .
But that &apos;s when I &apos;d think of Mom .
Her strength ... and courage .
And I &apos;d pray that maybe I &apos;d grow up to be as brave as she was .
And the bad thoughts would go away .
There were so many times I didn &apos;t think I could last another day .
I can &apos;t even tell you some of the things I thought about .
I love you too , Dad .
Goodnight .
I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m just so happy that you &apos;re safe .
That it &apos;s not over yet .
I know it &apos;s crazy , but I &apos;m really scared for the others .
I &apos;ve got this terrible feeling .
I will , Dad .
Bye , <unk> you .
I mean it .
Take care of it .
You got it , Dad .
I &apos;ll call you if I have a problem .
Your car &apos;s <unk> either transmission or <unk> fluid .
I want you to have it checked <unk> at a gas station .
Hey , Dad .
What &apos;s up ?
Kimberly ?
It &apos;s Dad .
I know , Dad .
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you &apos;ve handled yourself through all of this ...
I know , honey .
I just -- I know this is the first time we &apos;ve been apart since .
But everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
<unk> ?
Road flares ?
<unk> ?
<unk> ?
Relax , Dad .
It &apos;s <unk> , not <unk> .
You have everything , Kimberly ?
<unk> card , cell phone , <unk> card ?
Thanks , Dad .
I &apos;ll call you .
Nice try , <unk> .
You think the tooth fairy &apos;s gonna come tonight ?
I &apos;m thinkin &apos; like fifteen bucks .
You think ... You think those guys were <unk> us today or what ?
Jeez , Mom , stop <unk> &apos; .
You &apos;re all <unk> , you know that ?
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;ve been listening to this crap .
Come on , Tim , let &apos;s go outside .
Who am I , David <unk> ?
What on Earth are they doing ?
I know , we &apos;ll be there soon .
Damn , it really hurts , Mom .
When I do this .. it &apos;ll have skipped you ... and it &apos;ll all be over .
No !
No !
Don &apos;t !
You know what to do .
That &apos;s why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion ; Billy .
Police are coming .
Get out !
Get out of the car !
Get out !
Get out of the car !
Get out of the fuckin &apos; car !
Don &apos;t do it !
Don &apos;t do it !
Carter , get out !
Easy , Billy , just open it .
Can &apos;t you open the door ? !
Let us out !
Stop the car !
They blame me for everything .
Her , Tod , the plane crash ... Billy told the F.B.I.
he saw you runnin &apos; away from her house .
We &apos;re takin &apos; you to a cabin in the woods , it &apos;s only a couple miles from my house .
Keep off the <unk> , they &apos;ll be lookin &apos; for us .
I can &apos;t go home .
After Lewton &apos;s , they &apos;ll be after me .
Nothing is ... anymore .
No ..
I mean , I don &apos;t have anything on me .
This won &apos;t be safe .
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away .
Most kids never have it happen .
Most kids do , I guess .
Alex , on the plane ... you must have experienced ... some kind of <unk> awareness .
But here ... you &apos;re suggesting Tod &apos;s death ... and maybe our own ... will happen because of ... an active <unk> .
No , but it might as well be the same thing .
This was a message ... from someone , or something ... <unk> ... at the design .
I don &apos;t understand ... did you see Tod die ?
Did it happen again , like on the plane ?
That &apos;s total bullshit .
You can find death <unk> anywhere you want to .
I &apos;m not just layin &apos; down a bunch of math here , with this .
I &apos;m talking about <unk> ... <unk> ... that day , that we were meant to die .
That , if , we have been aware of ... would have saved everyone on the plane .
Wait .
I thought you meant the time of your birth .
Four / Twenty-five , as in , month and day ... that &apos;s a reach .
Right .
April 25th .
Remember the departure time ?
Remember the gate number ?
How many died on Flight 180 ?
From our group ?
As in <unk> and <unk> ?
He said Death has a design .
Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns .
<unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> !
He &apos;s not dead ?
<unk> !
fuck !
You fucking asshole .
You think this is funny , you fucking dick ?
Tod , if you &apos;re not dead I &apos;m gonna fucking kill you !
That &apos;s him , but ... he &apos;s not here .
I think .
But why &apos;d they make him up like ... Michael Jackson ?
<unk> &apos; somethin &apos; I &apos;m not supposed to .
Then , let &apos;s go see him !
I don &apos;t know .
I wish I could just see him ... one more time , then , maybe ...
I would know .
Is that something you &apos;re &quot; feeling ? &quot;
What if Tod ... is just the first ... of us ?
I &apos;ve never dealt with death before .
I wasn &apos;t alive when my <unk> died .
I wish I could know .
I mean , all this ... could just be in our heads .
Now it feels like it &apos;s everywhere .
That &apos;s why I was there last night .
Like you , the sculpture doesn &apos;t even know what , or why , it is .
<unk> to take form .
And , yet , creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction .
I &apos;m ... really sorry .
Not a <unk> .
It &apos;s how you make me feel , Alex .
It is .
But that didn &apos;t stop me .
Shouldn &apos;t stop you .
You went there ?
I &apos;ve wanted to go there , but I thought it was off limits .
Yeah , but everything &apos;s always in transition .
If you focus , even now , one week into summer ... you can feel Autumn coming .
Almost like bein &apos; able ... to see the future .
It &apos;s only the end of June .
He &apos;s not a witch .
How would I know ?
You think I &apos;m some sort of ... Of course not !
Gods aren &apos;t afraid to die !
Gods don &apos;t die !
We do !
&quot; <unk> ? &quot;
What are you , God now ? !
My <unk> in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design .
But I saved him .
I <unk> .
Just like the plane .
That &apos;s the design .
You &apos;re the fuckin &apos; devil .
You should have been next .
After Lewton , you should &apos;ve been next .
That &apos;s the only pattern .
You should be dead .
What &apos;s your fuckin &apos; worry ?
If it &apos;s not your time ... ?
I could get nailed runnin &apos; this red light and you all wouldn &apos;t get shit !
Only me , right ?
It doesn &apos;t matter who &apos;s next ... we &apos;re all on the same list .
You get off havin &apos; control over me .
Let me choose how to deal with it .
Is knowing going to make it easier ?
It makes it harder .
Why do you think I was hiding ?
Alright , Browning , you fuckin &apos; <unk> ... did you know about Ms. Lewton , or what ?
Look , there &apos;s something you should all know .
We &apos;re losing our favorite teacher .
All I owe is these people .
To live my life to the <unk> .
Hope you don &apos;t think , Browning , that because my name ain &apos;t on this wall ... that I owe you anything .
I wish you were on the plane !
You &apos;re payin &apos; for my trip , Browning !
Fuck you !
I &apos;ll remove myself !
I &apos;ll remove him .
That &apos;s a plan .
Me , too .
But my dad doesn &apos;t understand .
When he &apos;s better ; you and me , road trip to the City .
Catch the <unk> .
Been on many planes that blew up , have you ?
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded .
The the whole plane ... blew up .
It was so real .
Exactly how everything goes .
Because of you , I gotta sit here and watch fuckin &apos; &quot; <unk> . &quot;
C &apos;mon , man , like you really thought you were gonna <unk> fuck &apos; em over <unk> , or something ?
Dude , get wisdom .
We &apos;re about to board a seven hour flight .
The <unk> in coach are barely <unk> closets .
What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go <unk> a wicked cable and then right after you walks in <unk> or <unk> ?
You want them to associate with you with that <unk> gag and the <unk> sting in their eyes ?
Man , that is one George Michael notch from being gay .
No ...
I can &apos;t .
As long as I &apos;m in here , it &apos;s outta my control .
Alex ... can you promise me that no one else will die ?
Oh , you &apos;ve noticed it , too ?
Yes ... see , there &apos;s this ... pattern ... that &apos;s <unk> .
I believe that ... Ms. Lewton &apos;s next .
No .
I saw it .
I saw it !
Did you take any <unk> before <unk> , or on the plane .
Sleeping pills ?
I got this ... feeling ... a weird feeling ...
I can &apos;t explain it ... No harm .
No foul .
I &apos;m sorry we broke in .
You may not realize it , but we &apos;re all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail .
Every single move we make , from the <unk> to the <unk> ... the red light we stop at , or run ; the people we have sex with , or won &apos;t with us ; the airplane we ride , or walk out of ... is all a part of Death &apos;s sadistic design leading to the grave .
You saying Tod did kill himself ?
... there are no accidents .
No <unk> .
No <unk> .
And no ... <unk> .
His father &apos;s pretty fucked up with denial .
Maybe he couldn &apos;t deal with the thought of an other accident ... taking another son .
Why would he pull at the wire if he were <unk> suicide ?
I know who you are .
I &apos;m ... a friend of his .
His best friend .
See , his father ... No one &apos;s that strong .
Whatta &apos; you <unk> &apos; about ?
He said I &apos;m next .
<unk> &apos; felt up Tammy in the pool , that time ... Me , right ?
That &apos;s why you &apos;re not saying .
Please tell me I &apos;m gonna get to see the <unk> win the Super Bowl .
&apos;Cause if you say another word , I &apos;m gonna <unk> &apos; kill ya !
Hey , man , why &apos;d you say that ? !
Billy !
I &apos;m gettin &apos; a vision !
You &apos;re the next one ... And don &apos;t pass on the right .
WE DON &apos;T NEED THIS NOW !
SHUT UP , <unk> !
I &apos;m not afraid !
I <unk> <unk> IT &apos;S <unk> !
I control my life !
I control my death !
I know what you &apos;re doing !
It &apos;s alright to be scared , Carter .
You don &apos;t have to prove to us how big your balls are .
Not now .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m doin &apos; !
Get control of yourself !
Not with us in the fuckin &apos; car !
May as well go out under my own free will , right ?
Knock it off !
You have a responsibility to tell me .
He didn &apos;t say nothin &apos; .
Just drive .
They &apos;re watching me , see if I go to Alex .
So , why &apos;d you want us to meet you here ?
Now ?
Terry &apos;s name should be on this wall .
What are you doing ?
There &apos;s the Mekong .
... and there &apos;s this guy with a black helmet and cape , right , and he &apos;s got this sword ... except it &apos;s not a sword , it &apos;s light ... Hell .
This is just like fucking Star Wars , man !
Oh , yeah .
Listen , how long do they keep you in this disease hole ?
Maybe because you &apos;re shot in the leg .
Really ?
How come he didn &apos;t take me ?
Your buddy made it out last night .
The place went <unk> .
What just happened ?
Put it in the guard &apos;s <unk> .
Man they got pissed .
They beat the crap out of me , but ... it &apos;s kind of a tradition .
You oughta see &apos; em run around .
Yeah .
It &apos;s not hard once you get the hang of it .
In the wrist .
Anyway , I did what I always do when I get one ... You mean the snake ?
What kind of <unk> rescue you call this ?
I gotta tell you , it &apos;s just luck you guys came when you did .
They move us around a lot ... We only been at that camp a week .
Got a smoke ?
That &apos;s right , buddy .
Sorry , I mean ...
I talk to people all the time ...
I know a lot of them aren &apos;t there .
But this is real , isn &apos;t it ?
You &apos;re taking me home now ?
You guys are real ... aren &apos;t you ?
How much we got left in that <unk> ?
You &apos;re gonna love it .
It &apos;s a Soviet <unk> <unk> .
Probably has <unk> nose cannon , <unk> <unk> and wire <unk> <unk> , plus ...
Brewer !
You know what that thing &apos;s packing ?
Can you handle the door gun ?
Hold your <unk> .
Here , gimme a hand .
<unk> , you look awful .
What ... <unk> do ?
Are they going to torture us ?
Ain &apos;t you coming with us , sweet thing ?
You better take off .
You take pictures and split .
I &apos;m going in .
It &apos;s orders !
You remember ... when they tell you to do something and then you do it .
John Wayne is dead , man .
I suppose you have ... You never been in one of those things .
What ?
Are you crazy ?
We &apos;re supposed to take pictures and split .
You &apos;re gonna blow the whole program .
I &apos;m getting him out .
Nothing we can do , man .
That guy &apos;s not going to make it .
Bastards .
Let &apos;s get some shots .
<unk> cage .
Can &apos;t stand ... can &apos;t sit ... for days .
Sometimes weeks .
Alright .
Home run .
Let me see .
Can &apos;t tell .
Pretty tall .
He &apos;s real <unk> up in that thing .
It &apos;s a guy in a cage .
Guard <unk> .
Take some shots .

Five , six guys .
<unk> ... Vietnamese .
Somebody talking in his sleep .
A toilet <unk> .
I need a vacation .
How you doing , Brewer ?
<unk> ?
No kidding ?
Sometimes they do .
They &apos;re river pirates .
<unk> <unk> .
These guys look like they &apos;d sell their mothers .
Yeah .
<unk> , that &apos;s me .
Hey , Co . You wanna meet Jake the <unk> <unk> snake ?
She likes you .
Says you &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
What &apos;s she saying ?
Brewer .
Does a jet make noise ?
How come we didn &apos;t just drop near the camp ... save this <unk> ?
We &apos;ll check it out .
Who cares ?
Let &apos;s just do it and get out .
Go have a <unk> and get laid in <unk> .
Know what I mean ?
Why would they send us to a deserted camp ?
<unk> fish sauce .
What &apos;s this stuff on the rice ?
I had it <unk> .
You fucking crazy ?
I need it to burn these things off .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> century .
This place is a trip .
There are no worse places .
I &apos;ve seen worse places .
That &apos;s a real good reason to wind up in &apos; Nam .
I was in the <unk> .
They gave me a deal .
I blew up this Colonel &apos;s golf cart with an <unk> .
He wasn &apos;t in it or anything ... it was the symbolic value .
Seemed like a good idea at the time .
You wanna know why I stood up for this show ?
And a <unk> <unk> ?
Every <unk> in Nam &apos;s got one of those .
There &apos;s a <unk> in the handle .
That &apos;s it ?
Some <unk> , a map and a knife ?
Where &apos;s your stuff ?
<unk> party .
Uh huh , right .
Let &apos;s <unk> up .
<unk> &apos; <unk> &apos; <unk> mike with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters .
This is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> not included .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> grenade <unk> , with <unk> sound <unk> , <unk> <unk> scope and <unk> / <unk> <unk> sighting system .
What do you call that ?
Keep it down , man .
I got problems .
Home on my <unk> .
You read me , Brewer ?
You break your leg , I &apos;ll have to shoot you .
Yeah .
Why not ?
We &apos;re leaving tonight , not in a week .
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m here for .
Show me how it <unk> .
No radio source .
Nothing for the bad guys to <unk> on .
Yeah .
Second set .
Let &apos;s go .
Gettin &apos; old , huh ?
... then proceed <unk> to <unk> at point <unk> Delta .
<unk> takes us out by helicopter , we all live happily ever after and that &apos;s the last time , Rambo !
I swear to Christ .
... to target at Ban <unk> <unk> .
We probe the site ... Co <unk> <unk> .
The guide takes us twelve <unk> upriver to target at Ban ... at Ban ... <unk> <unk> .
Shit !
<unk> .
Call in to base camp by <unk> .
<unk> to point <unk> November for <unk> with our ground contact .
<unk> agent .
Co <unk> <unk> .
We &apos;ve been over this three times .
Ever do this from a jet ?
<unk> ?
Now back up there , buddy ...
This clown almost blew mission security on the street .
I &apos;m not jumping with him .
It doesn &apos;t hurt .
Why doesn &apos;t it hurt ?
John .
My name is John .
<unk> .
Come on .
Let &apos;s move .
He &apos;s coming in on our open side .
What was that ?
Why you don &apos;t feel love ?
Not allowed ?
Dead inside , maybe ?
You make yourself dead already so they can &apos;t kill you ?
<unk> ?
Bullshit !
Yes you can .
I couldn &apos;t get you in .
I know .
I go with you .
How you going to get there ?
You can &apos;t trust the spooks to pull you out .
They &apos;ll use you up and throw you away .
Go United States .
See Nguyen .
Maybe teach economics .
Buy Cadillac .
Watch &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Yeah .
Got some business there .
What are you gonna do ?
You try get across <unk> ?
Get to <unk> ?
<unk> .
But you get ass kicked without me .
You think you are ... .
<unk> .
Don &apos;t want to get shot by you .
Bad <unk> .
Anyway , you need me .
And how &apos;d you sneak up like that ?
Took bus , most of way .
I knew you would come here .
Christ .
How &apos;d you get here ?
Rambo .
NVA coming .
Pig dog <unk> say meet them here .
Whole <unk> from <unk> <unk> is out .
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio .
Make deal .
More than we pay .
Why &apos;d they want us ?
Yes .
But I lose many <unk> in next life .
Very bad .
Are you okay ?
Nguyen is good boy .
It &apos;s nice there .
He &apos;s probably digging every minute .
Got a <unk> .
<unk> girls &apos; hearts .
<unk> Beach , California .
Where &apos;s Nguyen now ?
What city ?
Where &apos;s his father ?
Nguyen .
He twelve now .
Not see him for eight years .
Oh .
They talk to me at <unk> before fall of Saigon .
Make deal .
How did you get started working for the spooks ?
I thought he was with you .
Where did you find this clown ?
I go up to this camp two months ago .
Nobody there .
<unk> for years .
I have arranged transportation .
We meet soon .
But I think you to be disappointed .
How do we get upriver ?
Sure .
I only sound like <unk> old in your language .
You really got a Masters <unk> ?
It means &quot; virgin . &quot;
My mother was comedian .
I &apos;m Rambo .
This is Brewer .
Her name is Co . Well , if there weren &apos;t POWs before , there are now .
You pathetic scum .
That &apos;s an order .
Sorry , Sir .
Can &apos;t do it .
Stay on your heading , Captain .
Let &apos;s get that tent down !
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at <unk> .
It says &quot; May have heat .
Don &apos;t be late .
All our love . &quot;
All this is for us ?
I was <unk> in <unk> .
I didn &apos;t know you were a stick man , Rambo .
Don &apos;t look so disappointed .
It should be hairy enough ... even for you .
We just take pictures ?
<unk> .
Absolutely not .
The phase two assault team will get them out .
We don &apos;t try to pull out any of our guys if we find them ?
This operation is in two <unk> .
Recon and rescue .
You are phase one .
Your <unk> team will probe the site , confirm the presence of American POWs , if any , make <unk> and tactical <unk> , then proceed to the <unk> point without <unk> the enemy .
What &apos;s the plan ?
<unk> <unk> on top will cover the details .
An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the <unk> <unk> may have a compound used as an <unk> camp .
As you can see the intelligence is soft .
These <unk> photos show huts ... <unk> .
It could be anything .
I &apos;m not jumping blind .
We like you .
At least the computer at <unk> likes you .
<unk> your file because of various <unk> .
Service record .
Area <unk> .
Classic special forces <unk> ... hit fast ... in and out .
Two men .
Two days .
What &apos;s the job ?
I &apos;m authorized to get you out of here .
I thought that &apos;s what you wanted .
I don &apos;t work with spooks .
Not after that <unk> in <unk> .
He ... took it .
... and then he , uh ... took the other one .
Um ... actually , no .
It looks like he shot down one of their <unk> ... Sir , there &apos;s something else ... a <unk> relay .
Just came through .
Half their air force is our stuff .
<unk> .
He &apos;s giving them a run for their money .
Says here they &apos;ve got two Hueys from Danang .
I didn &apos;t know those <unk> had Hueys .
It &apos;s not over .
You made one mistake .
You &apos;re out of your depth , <unk> .
Way out .
I &apos;m acting correctly here .
Not you .
Not your <unk> jungle ace .
It &apos;s over .
Walk away .
Of course not .
You can &apos;t get approval to rescue a <unk> from a tree after <unk> .
So there never was a <unk> Two rescue team ?
That &apos;s a crock .
We don &apos;t say that .
Do you have any idea the <unk> if he &apos;d gotten back with that guy ?
If it went public ?
The White House would have to act through channels .
We &apos;re talking ransom .
Four billion bucks in war <unk> to Vietnam to get the others back .
That &apos;s billion , Colonel .
With a &quot; B &quot; .
For a few guys that &apos;ve had their brains in a blender for ten years ?
A pain in the ass to everybody ?
No way .
There &apos;s no way .
&quot; Terminate with extreme <unk> . &quot;
It was clean .
Very clean ... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet , a former <unk> himself ... if he came out and said &quot; No POWs &quot; the <unk> would buy it .
He gets himself caught he &apos;s a private citizen , a whacko , acting on his own .
If he gets proof , it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C. <unk> .
But no ... Rambo &apos;s gotta be a hero .
Thinks he &apos;s <unk> in his own war movie or something .
He put me in a corner .
No choice .
Rambo and Brewer were selected as <unk> .
Word came down ... they wanted an answer .
And they knew the answer they wanted : no POWs .
But it had to look good .
Best effort .
The whole <unk> show .
This mission was a scam from the word go ?
Look , it was a <unk> , alright ?
They weren &apos;t supposed to find anything .
We thought that camp was empty .
Don &apos;t dance me , <unk> .
You &apos;ll be walking funny .
You think I &apos;m some whacko ?
I like to hurt people ?
I &apos;m doing a job here .
If I knew what &apos;s right or wrong I &apos;d be a goddamned priest , right ?
So I follow <unk> ...
I do what I &apos;m told .
It &apos;s simple .
If your boy had done what he was told , there wouldn &apos;t be a problem .
But you &apos;re right ... some people do get <unk> .
Now tell me why you pulled the plug .
Not my people .
Look , Colonel ... we &apos;re all adults here .
This is a war .
A very quiet , very intense war .
People get <unk> .
Take your time .
That &apos;s a pretty hairy ride .
Full <unk> are supposed to be above that sort of thing .
It &apos;s not necessary .
Listen , <unk> .
I &apos;m a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here ...
I thought I &apos;d go out with the <unk> team tonight .
Unless you have an <unk> .
The League of <unk> <unk> on Congress .
Then they lean on us .
Like we don &apos;t have enough to worry about in a dozen <unk> countries .
<unk> !
Black .
No sugar .
POWs ?
I don &apos;t know .
But either way it &apos;ll get that <unk> off our necks .
Cream ?
You think they &apos;ll find any ?
Couple hours .
Let me buy you a coffee .
How long before you &apos;re fully on line ?
About 22 hours on site .
How long have you been setting up ?
De <unk> .
Dave De <unk> .
Lieutenant ... Air Force .
What &apos;s your name ?
I could a couple of days ago .
Gonna be ... stiff .
Can you walk ?
Man , you are one <unk> motherfucker !
American .
Come to get you out .
You got it , sir .
Keep it clean , Rambo , or I &apos;ll nail your hide to the shed .
Let &apos;s do it .
I say we tape him to a chair .
Listen up .
You two are married as of now .
Get used to it .
This just occurred to somebody , now ?
We left some people behind there , John ... POWs .
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in .
I just wanted ...
I don &apos;t know ... after all that ...
I just wanted one person , one person , to come up to me and say &quot; you did good , John . &quot;
And mean it .
That &apos;s all .
After all that .
What did you want ?
Five .
I never wanted that stuff .
Plus , what else ?
Two Silver <unk> , four <unk> <unk> , two Soldier &apos;s <unk> , four Vietnamese <unk> of <unk> and ... uh , a handful of Purple Hearts .
Yeah .
Big time .
<unk> <unk> of Honor .
Those men are all dead .
<unk> outfit .
The best I ever trained .
That &apos;s it .
My life .
This your stuff ?
Hard to believe .
You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun ... one little <unk> town ... and everybody figures your <unk> &apos;s broken .
No sense of humor .
What did you expect ?
An <unk> plague from the chamber of <unk> ?
There were treating me like a headcase .
That depends on you .
Christ , look at you .
I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment ... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap <unk> ... and you have to make it Rambo &apos;s last stand .
Am I out of here ?
Seems like I &apos;m always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other , doesn &apos;t it ?
I could take it or leave it .
I hear you &apos;re not enjoying it here .
Mind if I sit down ?
Hey ?
What did I tell you ?
Why don &apos;t you come ?
It &apos;s just dinner .
You &apos;ll have something to tell your mother next time she calls .
No really .. I can &apos;t .
The nails ! !
Watch the nails ! ! ...
Listen , you still have to eat .
Oh , no .. I have to get home ... You know , let me tell you something !
I &apos;m not that kind of person .
I don &apos;t do people favors .
If I talk to you it &apos;s because I want to .
So we &apos;re not all ... uh ... <unk> Hall ... Big deal ... What a boring world if we were .
You do the best you can with what you got .
You &apos;re not so so invisible , ya know ... You want make an impression ?
Try this ; you can be a real bitch .
I &apos;m paying you .
That &apos;s not true ... You gotta ease up ...
<unk> have a life of their own .
You gotta just go with it ... We &apos;re having a lovely conversation .
I don &apos;t feel like I make any impression on people ... At office parties I spend my time <unk> the hors d &apos;oeuvres as people eat them , so the <unk> will always look full .
I don &apos;t start conversations because I have no idea how to end them ... I think I &apos;m just meant to live in the background of things .
I don &apos;t understand you .
What is the problem ?
I think some people are meant to be alone .
Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I &apos;m paying for it - which would be fine , if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts ...
I can &apos;t believe you lived with her for that long .
If I had to live with my mother , I &apos;d <unk> myself six times .
... My mother calls every week .
Like a <unk> nightmare .
&quot; So , have you met anyone ? &quot; ...
&quot; No mom &quot; .. &quot; So what &apos;s going to happen ? &quot; ...
&quot; I don &apos;t know Mom &quot; ...
I only thank God I moved out .
It &apos;s a disgusting process .
You haven &apos;t missed anything .
I never really ... went through a ... dating period .
Tell me about it .
I &apos;ve been dating longer than I &apos;ve been driving .
I can &apos;t believe that .
<unk> ... people .
I mean , it &apos;s not easy in this day and age .
Well , there &apos;s nobody special !
Well , don &apos;t say it like that .
It &apos;s not so ... ya know , crazy an idea .
You are a healthy woman ... You hold a steady job .
Ya not crossed <unk> or anything ... Do I look like I have someone special ?
... SO ... anybody special in your life ?
It &apos;s an awful thing , let me tell you .
My Aunt used to say , &quot; divorce is the <unk> of death &quot; .
My parents were divorced .
You threw him out ?
... So he says to me , &quot; you &apos;ll never find another man like me &quot; ... I said , &quot; please , men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother &apos;s leg ...
I said , there &apos;s the door - take a trip .
That all depends on you .
... Sure you don &apos;t want a drink ?
Will it hurt ?
No , thank you .
Can I get you anything ... coffee ... tea ... a little <unk> ?
I &apos;ve never been in an apartment above a store .
You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them .
Ah ...
I do them myself .
I used to work in a beauty parlor .
I like your nails .
Where did you get them done ?
Well , I guess I &apos;ll come back then .
Yes !
They &apos;ll be in soon .
Well did you or didn &apos;t you ?
You know , I think I ... ordered some just the other day .
But now it &apos;s free , right ?
This will last you one year after which you have the option to <unk> if ... you like at a membership discount .
Huh ... the restaurant &apos;s just around the corner here ... Yep !
Right on it !
&lt; u &gt; What are you , out of your mind &lt; / u &gt; !
<unk> &apos; my penis ... What a lovely way of sayin &apos; how Much ya like me ... Why this is outrageous ! ...
Most men are .
I &apos;m shocked .
With a child <unk> body like yours ... ... why a man would have to be out of his mind !
&lt; u &gt; You &apos;re surprised &lt; / u &gt; ! ...
But I guess I just never met the right guy .
Whatta gonna do ?
Jack , he &apos;s starting a conversation ...
This food &apos;s delicious .
You &apos;re a wonderful cook .
And you have a lovely home .
I mean , I &apos;ve gone out with <unk> , but they were gorgeous .
It &apos;s the only reason to go out with a bum .
Got any more bread <unk> ?
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and &lt; u &gt; him &lt; / u &gt; ... She didn &apos;t even look at him .
Huh-huh .... You son of a bitch !
I think ..
I ... I realized ... I love you .
Terrific .
Going on <unk> of dates ... seeing lots of men ... lots of dates .. How have you been ?
Well !
What do you want me to do - <unk> ?
Then what do you want to stay with me for ?
Oh yeah ?
What did I get ?
What did I get I couldn &apos;t&apos;ve gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week ?
You think your company is such a treat ?
Your moods , your ... &quot; pain &quot; , your problems ... You think you &apos;re <unk> ?
&lt; u &gt; Listen &lt; / u &gt; !
We both got something out of it , all right !
What have you been doing here !
&lt; u &gt; Huh &lt; / u &gt; !
&lt; u &gt; I wanna know &lt; / u &gt; !
&lt; u &gt; What have you been &lt; / u &gt; &lt; u &gt; doing here &lt; / u &gt; ? !
All right ...
I &apos;ll pack my stuff tonight .
Bullshit !
If you &apos;re going to hurt me , you hurt me now -- not some long ... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don &apos;t have the balls !
I didn &apos;t know .
I just said all I want is some time .
You can &apos;t even give me that ? !
What were you gonna do , Jack ? ...
Just gonna organize your life ... ... walk out that door , move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else ?
What were you planning to do , Jack ?
No .
So what time do you need ?
I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going , great !
I &apos;d like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that !
So what do you need to figure out alone ! ?
First of all , let me tell you something -- you don &apos;t know shit .
Second of all , as far as &lt; u &gt; we &lt; / u &gt; go , what time do you need ?
What have we been doing here , except &lt; u &gt; time &lt; / u &gt; ?
Have I ever ... ever <unk> you ! ?

I &apos;d like to focus on my career - - now than I can , now that everything &apos;s all right ... Parry &apos;s taken care of ... and ... Like I said , I feel like I know a lot more now and I don &apos;t ...
Right now , I &apos;m just not sure about ... making such <unk> plans .
<unk> things down ?
Where have I been ?
Have we been going fast ! ?
...
Listen , so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little .
No ... it &apos;s just ... You want to talk ?
Come on , Jack ... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what ?
No , I ...
I think we should talk about this .
&quot; I &apos;m an incredible woman ? &quot;
What is this , a death sentence ?
No , it &apos;s not ... Come here ... ...
What ? ...
You don &apos;t want to <unk> ?
...
I would love to start looking at least .
You know , maybe a two bedroom or even , maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or <unk> Island ... Ugh , these tapes are a mess .
I don &apos;t know where to begin ...
Ya know , I &apos;m thinkin &apos; -- with another income coming in , I would love to get a bigger place .
It &apos;s so great to see you like this , honey ...
I can &apos;t tell you .
&lt; u &gt; You &lt; / u &gt; made coffee ? ...
You &apos;re going back to work &lt; u &gt; and &lt; / u &gt; you made coffee ? ...
I love this !
I &apos;ve got to put these tapes in some kind of order ... and ... Oh , I should get my sports jacket cleaned ... ...
There &apos;s coffee if you want ... &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; !
Oh , honey , that &apos;s terrific !
He says if I want to get back to work , no problem .
He wants me to come in and talk and ... and ... &lt; u &gt; that &apos;s &lt; / u &gt; &lt; u &gt; it &lt; / u &gt; !
You &apos;re kidding !
What did he say ?
My agent .
I called my agent .
So what &apos;s going on ?
Who &apos;s Lou again ?
You were great .
Thanks <unk> .
Well ... I think you should feel very proud .
You did a real nice thing for somebody else .
I &apos;m very proud .
Nothing it &apos;s just ... I <unk> to understand you .
Who &apos;s knows .
My Aunt Marge used to say , &quot; some matches are made in heaven , some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores &quot; .
You know , I can &apos;t believe I did it .
You think it &apos;ll work out ?
I think they &apos;re made for each other .
And it scares me .
What do you think ?
Well .. everything &apos;s closed up .
We thought we &apos;d get some dinner .
Say ! .... Anybody up for Chinese ?
Have you eaten ?
Would you like to come along ?
What are you two up to ?
Thank you very much .
Well talk back .
He won &apos;t bite you .
He just needs some clothes ?
I don &apos;t know ...
He &apos;s a little disgusting ...
Although some women go for that .
And this is our other .. uh ... <unk> .. Parry .. uh ... Parry ....
I thought ... if ... if I can help him in some way ... you know ? ...
get him this girl he loves ... Then ... maybe .... things &apos;ll start changing for me ... My luck , ya know ... Maybe ...
Forget it ...
It &apos;s a stupid idea .
Well , what the hell does that mean ?
See , I told you !
What does that mean ?
All right ...
Sorry ...
I feel <unk> to him .
Don &apos;t treat me like I &apos;m stupid .
It pisses me off .
I ... You &apos;re not going to understand this .
What ?
The curse &apos;ll be lifted ?
&lt; u &gt; Will &lt; / u &gt; &lt; u &gt; you please &lt; / u &gt; !
Lydia is the girl Parry likes ... And I thought , if I could get them together I ... And who &apos;s Lydia ?
He &apos;s not a moron .
I was not with a woman last night .
I was out with Parry .
... &lt; u &gt; Forget it &lt; / u &gt; ... &lt; u &gt; Goodbye &lt; / u &gt; !
...
I don &apos;t get a friggin &apos; phone call .
You stroll in here at noon .
I got ... two people out sick .
Ya think I need this ?
I Do Not Need This !
What ... No ... Lydia ...
I want to speak to ... her name is Lydia ...
I ... uh ... You &apos;re calling &lt; u &gt; Lydia &lt; / u &gt; in &lt; u &gt; my &lt; / u &gt; office .
You must think I &apos;m some dope .
You fuckin &apos; bastard ... You ... ... stay out all night long ...
I don &apos;t know her last name ...
I &apos;ll be off in a second .
Lydia ? !
Lydia who ! ?
Hello , I &apos;d like to speak to Lydia ?
Can I have my desk please .
I wish there was some way I could ... just ... pay the fine and go home .
You didn &apos;t kill anybody .
Stop .
I get this feeling like I &apos;m ... a <unk> but I attract shit .
Out of all the people in this city , why did I meet a man who &apos;s wife I killed ?
Oh stop .
Things will change .
My Aunt Mary always said , there &apos;s a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class .
I tell you something , Anne .
I really feel like I &apos;m cursed .
Oh , I got a <unk> ...
This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color ... Like it really works , ya know ... ... You have a little ... uh ... something on your face ... Oh sure ... Gotta believe in God .
But I don &apos;t think God made man in his own image .
No .
&apos;Cause most of ... the bullshit that happens , is because of men .
No , I think man was made out of the devil &apos;s image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating , and which also explains why women are attracted to men , because , lets face it , the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you ...
&lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; ! ! ! ...
And so the whole point of life , I think , is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and , ya know -- work it out ... ... Not that we have to get married .
You still believe in God ?
Oh , I used to be such a Catholic .
Okay .
...
I love you ...
I &apos;m not seeing anyone else .
I really was attacked .
Please ... before you go on ... let me <unk> ... okay ... We &apos;ve had a wonderful time together ...
When we first met , you said this wasn &apos;t serious and I shouldn &apos;t get serious and then you moved in and we haven &apos;t been serious .
And I just wanna say that I have no regrets .
None .
And don &apos;t wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me ...
I want the truth .
If you &apos;re seein &apos; somebody else , let me know ... You don &apos;t have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me .
Just tell me the truth .
I ...
I stayed at a friend &apos;s .
Listen , I -- ...
So ... where did you sleep last night ?
You &apos;re all right ... you sure ... No , I &apos;m fine ... really ... You were attacked .
My God .
Should I call a doctor !
Did you call the police ... &lt; u &gt; Oh my God &lt; / u &gt; ... &lt; u &gt; What did they do &lt; / u &gt; !
&lt; u &gt; My &lt; / u &gt; &lt; u &gt; God &lt; / u &gt; ! ! !
Two kids tried to set me on fire .
I was attacked .
I can &apos;t tell you how <unk> I was .
All night long .
What the hell happened ?
I smell gas ... Do you smell gas ... Yeah , well ... suicidal <unk> say funny things sometimes .
It happens to be a beautiful love story .
Ya know , you used to like that about me .
You used to say you liked that I didn &apos;t make you think so much .
That we could be together and not think ... Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn &apos;t know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I &apos;m not really talented .
Then why the hell do we watch all the time ?
It &apos;s not funny .
It &apos;s ... <unk> and <unk> ... and dumb .
Well , it &apos;s funny !
Whatta want from me ?
Why don &apos;t you go upstairs ... take the day off .
All right ? ... I &apos;ll cook tonight .
Anne , they &apos;re MY moods .
If you want to understand moods , have one of your own !
Are you in a mood today baby ?
Is this one of those days when you &apos;re in ... <unk> call it ... an emotional <unk> ?
Talk to me , cause I don &apos;t understand these moods .
You &apos;d have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn &apos;t be the best thing for him .
He needs hospital care .
I just thought you could sign the release forms , but the city can do that .
I wouldn &apos;t feel responsible in any way .
There &apos;s really nothing you can do .
I &apos;m sorry .
What if I was a relative ?
Well , it &apos;s not unusual in his case ...
Sometimes victims of <unk> are subject to the brain &apos;s <unk> system .
The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits .
A person could actually <unk> the full effect of a tragedy , long after the event took place .
Are you relatives ?
Well , it doesn &apos;t matter .
We &apos;ll take care of it .
He &apos;ll have to be sent back to the same institution ..
But .. How could that happen ?
I &apos;m afraid not ... Then again , I &apos;m not sure .
The beating &apos;s bad but it &apos;s not the problem ...
It seems he &apos;s .. <unk> the <unk> ...
So , like before , he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years ...
.... I don &apos;t know .
There &apos;s no way to tell .
Yeah so ?
The guy &apos;s beat up - he ... he probably has a <unk> or something , right ?
He &apos;ll snap out of it ?
He can &apos;t hear you .
Hi ... I &apos;m Dr. <unk> ....
I was on duty when they brought him in ... I &apos;ve been going over his record ...
He was brought in once before I understand ... ... &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; ... condition <unk> him <unk> for a period of - ... She &lt; u &gt; likes &lt; / u &gt; me .
She said for me to call !
She gave you the old <unk> , <unk> ...
Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate ... No , Jack , no , it &apos;s not ... She likes me .
Yeah , Edwin , &lt; u &gt; sure &lt; / u &gt; ... and &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; is a true story ... &lt; u &gt; Edwin !
Wake up ! &lt; / u &gt; This is a <unk> ...
I think she likes me ... she gave me her number , but she must work a lot cause when I call she &apos;s never home ...
But I think we &apos;ll go out this weekend ...
I &apos;ve ... Yeah , but does she swallow , Edwin ?
Okay ...
I know but ...
I met this beautiful girl ... Yeah , I know the place .
It &apos;s one of those <unk> &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; gathering holes .
I ...
I ... went to this bar ... this very , ya know -- <unk> place ... called <unk> &apos;s ...
So , Edwin , baby , this is <unk> <unk> time ... what have you got for us ?
He &apos;s not here .
I &apos;m ... just looking for Parry ... Can I help you ?
He and his wife was were at some bar .. and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart .
She was a beautiful girl ... She never knew what hit her .
Yeah , well ...
I let him stay there .
What else could I do after such a tragedy ?
No ...
He is supposed to live there ?
You a friend of Parry &apos;s ?
&lt; u &gt; I tell him no visitors &lt; / u &gt; ! ! !
Uh ... basement I think ... Where you comin &apos; from ? !
I &apos;m a man with a mission , Jack .
Remember .
One <unk> and out .
Oh please ! ... I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn ...
I &apos;ve been to hell and back ....
I &apos;ll be fine ...
.... Thanks ... You &apos;re a <unk> .
Um ... I &apos;ve got to run .
I &apos;ve bee doing this all day .
Are you going to be all right ?
Well , ...
I &apos;m a singer by trade ... <unk> stock ... <unk> <unk> ... that kind of thing ... It used to be what I absolutely lived for ... God ... I can do <unk> backwards - every <unk> but , one night ... in the middle of singing &quot; Funny ..... - it suddenly hit me ... ... what does all of this really mean ?
That , and the fact that all my friends are dead ... God , I sound like a <unk> .
Dad would be so proud .
Can you tell me something ?
Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow <unk> process ?
Venice ... Like Katherine Hepburn in <unk> .
.
.... Why can &apos;t I be Katherine Hepburn ... Come on ... maybe we can ... where do you want to go ?
No ... no ... we can &apos;t ... we can &apos;t .. Where ?
Maybe we can .
A real nice place I know ... Ah ... can &apos;t get there !
Not tonight .
Uh ... Where ... where do you want to go ?

It was a crime .

It &apos;s <unk> ... It &apos;s <unk> ... Lets me help you up .
Good .
You believe this drunk ?
Yes ...
I ...
I agree ... People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood .
It &apos;s not fair ... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets ...
I ...
I was just leaving .
You shouldn &apos;t hang around this neighborhood .
I used to think my <unk> would be JACK <unk> - THE FACE <unk> THE <unk> , but now it can be JACK <unk> , THE FACE &quot; AND &quot; THE <unk> ... or maybe just JACK - <unk> <unk> ...
I was nine in the sixties .
How <unk> of you .
No , I have to work .
I &apos;ll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing <unk> hairs on <unk> <unk> .
Want some ?
Jack , it &apos;s a <unk> -- you &apos;re not <unk> <unk> .
... First time in my life I &apos;ll be a voice with a body .
Do you know what that means ?
What this could lead to ?
They &apos;re putting me on film tomorrow .
Fine .
I &apos;ll say no .
You know , tomorrow &apos;s a very big day for me ...
It would be nice if you acted like you understood .
You &apos;re so <unk> .
I &apos;m so jealous ...
I &lt; u &gt; need &lt; / u &gt; to get out of here , Jack , and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page .
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with ... &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; ?
You can ask .
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it <unk> the <unk> steel .
Tonight !
How &apos;s tonight ?
Okay ... twenty dollars ...
When can you ... Well , since you &apos;re a member , we could ... You know , Anne does other people too .
Sort of a <unk> ...
Yes .
They &apos;re free .
Uh ... you ... you can pick out up to ten movies ... Well .. um ... you get an official membership card ... Just sign that and we &apos;ll <unk> it right here ... Parry ?
You want to <unk> Miss <unk> &apos;s card ? ...
So how do we do this ?
Yes .
Hi .. Congratulations .
Jack Lucas .
Nice to meet you finally .
This is Anne <unk> , the owner of <unk> <unk> .
Hello .
My name is Lydia <unk> .
&lt; u &gt; No ! &lt; / u &gt; &lt; u &gt; I told you &lt; / u &gt; !
&lt; u &gt; You won a contest &lt; / u &gt; !
Did <unk> in <unk> tell you to call me ?
You get a VCR with the membership .
... For a short time until you get your own .
Listen , why don &apos;t you come down to the store and you can check it out .
See if you &apos;re interested .
Well , I mean ...
I don &apos;t know you ...
This has never ...
I &apos;ve never won anything and ...
I don &apos;t have a VCR .
Well there .... What &apos;s the difference ?
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what ?
Well , I don &apos;t understand .
What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or ... or ... a list ?
Your name was picked .
All of them ...
Which means &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue .
Well , congratulations Lydia , because out of several thousand card holders ... in <unk> with several major credit card companies ...
Yes well ... You are a credit card holder , are you not ?
Yeah ?
Who is this ?
No ... no ... that &apos;s all right ...
I thought I knew her ...
Thanks ... God , I have no idea .
She &apos;s worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea .
I &apos;ll call her .
Lydia .
Lydia what ?
Uh ... she was wearing a kind of ... a <unk> kind of ... uh ... plain ... What girl ?
I didn &apos;t notice .
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in ... Yeah ..... Hey they &apos;re moving .... Am I doing that ?
Beautiful night huh ?
Parry , it &apos;s Lydia <unk> - our membership winner .
I &apos;m still scared .
No .
Nothing bad &apos;s going to happen .
Anne &apos;ll be there .
I &apos;ll be there .
Nothing bad will happen .
... I feel so much for her ... I feel like something awful is going to happen .
What are the other reasons ?
No .
But that &apos;s not the only reason people get together or .. stay together .
Tch ... how romantic .
Yeah .
If I wasn &apos;t already committed to Lydia , boy .
Except Anne &apos;d never go for me though .
She loves you too much .
And you really love her , huh ?
In a bar called <unk> .
I &apos;m sorry .... I &apos;m just so excited .
You must have felt this way when you first met Anne , huh ?
Where did you two meet ?
Will you stand still so I can do this !
&lt; u &gt; Parry &lt; / u &gt; !
Close your pants ... <unk> &apos; my penis ... Is that what your girlfriend does for you ?
Bad example .
Just trust me .
A woman who loves you keeps you going ... gives you strength ... Makes you feel like you can do anything ... <unk> married , probably .
Well , see , I think she can help ... You know women are great .. they ... they make homes and they .. ya know , kill the <unk> so the knights can go out and get <unk> and ... and slaughter <unk> with a clear head ... I mean , where would Arthur be without <unk> ... Maybe , when we get the Grail ... Parry , you don &apos;t have to &lt; u &gt; earn &lt; / u &gt; a woman .
It &apos;s the <unk> century .
I can &apos;t ask for her ... I have to earn her .
Then let &apos;s begin with the story itself .
It &apos;s a story of the Grail myth ... And although there are several <unk> , my favorite begins with the <unk> King as a young boy ... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage ... and during that night , he is visited by a sacred vision .
Out of the fire , appears the Holy Grail - God &apos;s highest symbol of divine grace .
And a voice says to the boy , &quot; You shall be the <unk> of the Grail , that it may heal the hearts of men &quot; ... But the boy was overcome ... <unk> and foolish , he was blinded by greater <unk> - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory , hope and power ... <unk> filled his eyes as he sensed his own ... <unk> .
A boy &apos;s tears of naive wonder and inspiration .
and in this state of ... radical <unk> ... he felt for a brief moment , not like a boy , but like God ... ... And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail .
And the Grail vanished .
And the boy hands were left caught in the flames ... leaving him <unk> and ashamed at what his <unk> had lost him .
When he became King , he was determined to <unk> his destiny and find the Grail ...
But with each year that passed , with each campaign he fought , the Grail <unk> lost , and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse ...
He became a bitter man .
Life for him lost it &apos;s reason .
With each disappointment , with each <unk> ... with each loss ... this wound would grow ...
Soon the land began to spoil from <unk> and his people starved ... Until finally , the King lost all faith in God &apos;s <unk> and in man &apos;s value ... He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience ... that he started to die .
As the years went on , his <unk> knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land , but to no <unk> .
Pretty soon , finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men <unk> for the King &apos;s power , which only confirmed the King &apos;s worst suspicions of man , causing his wound to grow .
His only hope , he thought , was death .
Then one day , a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him .
He was a <unk> man ... not particularly <unk> ... or admired ...
He tells the King some jokes ... sing him some songs , but the King feels even worse ... Finally , the fool says , &quot; What is it that hurts you so much ?
How can I help ?
&quot; ... And the King says , &quot; I need a <unk> of water to cool my throat &quot; ... So , the fool takes a cup from the <unk> , <unk> it with water and hands it to the King ... Suddenly , the King feels a lot better .
And when he looks to his hands , he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool <unk> him ... an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along ... And the King asks , &quot; How can this be ? ... how could you find what all my knights and <unk> men could not find &quot; ?
And the fool answers , &quot; I don &apos;t know .
I only knew you were thirsty . &quot; ...
And for the first time since he was a boy , the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God &apos;s glory ... but rather , by the compassion of a fool .
Are there any questions ?
YOU &apos;RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING <unk> ! !
Who are you talking to Jack ?
.. Ha ... Little fella ?
I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he &apos;s naked in the middle of Central Park .
I should be surprised ?
I &apos;m not surprised .
I &apos;m fucking outta my mind to even be here !
NO !
I will not !
This is nuts !
I &apos;m leaving !
I mean it ... this is nuts .
This is too nuts ... I &apos;m leaving .

Come on , try it .
Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella &apos;s <unk> &apos; in the <unk> .

Come on !
You can &apos;t do this !
This is New York !
Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York .. It &apos;s ... it &apos;s too <unk> .
Have you ever done any <unk> ?
You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds ... and you try yo break them apart with your mind .
It &apos;s wild .
..... What are you doing ?
Yes .
I think that &apos;s very fair .
Well that &apos;s stupid .
This is my park just as much as it is theirs .
You think it &apos;s fair they keep us out just because they make us think we &apos;ll get killed or something ?
Don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time to go now ?
Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people .
It &apos;s a classic .
It &apos;s such a great song .
Well , maybe he wants to stay here .
Do ... do you want to stay here ?
Listen , he just needs to sleep it off .
Someone will take care of him .
Buddy , the days of the <unk> are ... not what they used to be .
The Red ... ?
You &apos;re totally gone , aren &apos;t you ?
The Red Knight !
WHO !
WHO &apos;S <unk> ? ! !
WHO HAVE WE BEEN <unk> ! ? ?

He &apos;s gone now , but we had him on the run !
We would &apos;ve had his ass if we had horses !
He &apos;s running scared !
You &apos;re totally gone , aren &apos;t you ?
He knows who you are !
He &apos;s afraid !

Just &lt; u &gt; like &lt; / u &gt; magic .

I don &apos;t need a job .
I have a quest .
Look , you &apos;re only sort of insane , really .
People like you can lead <unk> lives .
You could get a job ... Of course there is , Jack .
What do you think the <unk> were - a <unk> initiation ?
I don &apos;t think so ... There has to be a Grail .
All right !
Listen - please ... don &apos;t start <unk> or ... rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn &apos;t do this .. There is no Holy Grail .
<unk> ... let me explain this one more time ... The Holly Grail is in - .... You can &apos;t just break into <unk> <unk> &apos;s house .
This man has done nothing .
Pretty impressive huh ? ... Don &apos;t let it scare you .
I &apos;ll admit it &apos;s <unk> but everything has it &apos;s weakness .
You really want to help me ?
I don &apos;t know .
But I gave it to you ... to help YOU ... not him .
Well what am I gonna do with it ?
But I gave it to you !
What are you doing ?
Give that back !
Well , I think you should be realistic .
Ya can &apos;t start an ad agency on fifty dollars !
No .. I have to get back to work .
Take care of yourself .
Can I take you to lunch ?
No .. no , it &apos;s .. I don &apos;t know what to say .
This is so nice of you ... Jack ...
Here &apos;s another twenty .
Will that do ?
I mean , what &apos;s it going to take !
Here ... I just would like to help you .
I thought ... maybe ... you could use some money .
Well , if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a <unk> , I think they might alter their behavior .
