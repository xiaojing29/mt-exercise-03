No , you look good .
And the tests came back fine .
C &apos;mon ... Really ?
I don &apos;t feel so great .
I &apos;ve got some good news .
The doctor says you &apos;re all better .
You can come home .
Fine .
Let them !
There is no such thing as bad press .
A man from New York even said he &apos;s putting me on the front page !
First celebrity to ever check into <unk> .
When I get out of here , I will be healthy .
Strong !
I will be <unk> for my comeback !
Bela , they &apos;re parasites !
They just want to exploit you .
Isn &apos;t it wonderful ?
After all these years , the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi .
Don &apos;t worry .
Everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
I &apos;m sorry , Eddie .
I &apos;m so sorry .
Bela , I &apos;m on your side .
C &apos;mon , give me the gun ...
If you give me the gun , I &apos;ll make you a drink .
What are you drinking ?
It &apos;ll be wonderful .
We &apos;ll be at peace .
In the afterlife , you don &apos;t have to worry about finding work .
Buddy , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s such a good idea .
I &apos;m <unk> .
I have nothing to live for .
Tonight , I should die .
And you should come with me .
Don &apos;t you have any savings ?
Eddie , I received a letter from the government .
They &apos;re cutting off my <unk> .
That &apos;s all I &apos;ve got .
Without it , I can &apos;t pay the rent ... Jesus Christ , what an evening .
What happened ?
I was thinking about killing myself .
What are you doing ?
<unk> .
She changed her mind .
She doesn &apos;t wanna marry me .
Can you put down the gun ?
Why aren &apos;t you on your <unk> ?
Where &apos;s <unk> ?
Shit !
Bela , what &apos;s with the gun ?
Why are you here ? ?
I know it &apos;s a lot to give you at the last second .
Eddie , this is quite a scene .
I wrote something special for you .
I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you &apos;ve made ... and so I wrote you a new final speech .
Well , there aren &apos;t too many other fellas I &apos;d do it for ... No .
Seriously .
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you &apos;ve done for me .
A great man like you shouldn &apos;t have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning .
That &apos;s fine , Eddie .
All in the line of duty .
Bela .
I just wanna thank you again for last night .
Alright !
Let &apos;s put it on film .
<unk> !
<unk> !
Don &apos;t let me slow you down .
Bela , I &apos;ve got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight .
After I did &quot; Dracula , &quot; the studio offered me &quot; <unk> &quot; !
But I turned it down , the part wasn &apos;t sexy enough .
It was too <unk> for a big star like me .
Do you know I turned down &quot; <unk> &quot; ?
Bela , somebody <unk> the motor .
So when you wrestle the octopus , shake the legs a bit , to make it look like it &apos;s killing you .
Okay !
How do we turn this thing on ?
Fuck you !
&lt; u &gt; You &lt; / u &gt; come out here .
Hey , toss me that J.D.
Once you &apos;re in it , it <unk> up .
Goddamn , it &apos;s cold !
Oh , for Christ &apos;s sake .
This &apos;ll look a lot better .
We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater .
Out &lt; u &gt; there &lt; / u &gt; ? !
What happened to the stream ?
You &apos;ll be fighting with the octopus .
Let &apos;s shoot this fucker !
Where do I go ?
Nonsense !
You look great -- Look , uh , why don &apos;t you lie down and take a little nap ?
We &apos;ll film around you for a while .
Eddie , I &apos;m so tired ...
I don &apos;t know if I can handle a night shoot ...
Correct .
So instead , I stayed here , waiting for my comeback .
Always hoping ... the next film , the next film ... that would be the one .
But maybe not .
I didn &apos;t know if it was a trick .
They might arrest me and throw me in a <unk> .
I am <unk> &apos;s most famous <unk> .
they &apos;d use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave .
So why didn &apos;t you do it ?
It was a very impressive offer .
<unk> offices , a big home ...
I &apos;d be treated like a king .
In life , the decisions that <unk> you are the ones where you just don &apos;t know ... where right or wrong will never be answered .
Years ago , the <unk> contacted me .
The government wanted me to come home , to be Minister of <unk> .
Yeah , I did .
Eddie , you screwed up .
But was it a bad decision ?
At the time , I thought her money would save the movie .
Bad decisions are easy to live with .
Forget .
Just keep looking forward .
Was I wrong to cast Loretta ?
This is the <unk> Research Society .
A refuge for free <unk> .
I &apos;ve been coming here for twenty years .
What is this place ?
Stop worrying .
This is going to raise your spirits .
Bela , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doin &apos; anymore ... &quot; Dear , you &apos;re lovely . &quot;
&quot; <unk> her to the table . &quot;
That &apos;s fine , Bela .
We &apos;re still rolling .
Just say &quot; Dear , you &apos;re lovely . &quot;
&quot; Dear , you are a woman of super strength and beauty .
A lovely vision of <unk> beauty -- shit ! &quot;
Damn !
Eddie , I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t remember all this .
I &apos;m an old man .
It &apos;s too long .
Okay .
Then you &apos;ll be sitting on the &lt; u &gt; left &lt; / u &gt; .
I &apos;m not getting near that goddamn thing .
One of those burned me on &quot; The Return Of <unk> . &quot;
You &apos;ll be sitting on the right .
You &apos;re shooting &quot; Bride Of The Atom . &quot;
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> ?
Where am I ?
Bela , are you ready ?
We didn &apos;t make a dime .
So how &apos;d we do ?
Forget about it .
We &apos;ll make our new movie , and you &apos;ll be a star again .
I never said I could <unk> ... Bela , don &apos;t worry .
You &apos;re better than all this crap .
<unk> !
How do they expect a Hungarian to <unk> this dialogue ?
This live television is madness !
No Bela , that &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Look , just say &quot; This casket has ... &quot; &quot; Beg to differ .
This casket <unk> , er , <unk> -- &quot; &quot; Oh , tract housing , huh ? &quot;
<unk> .
&quot; You need a new real estate agent . &quot;
&quot; It is my home . &quot;
&quot; Greetings .
I am <unk> <unk> , <unk> of Adventure . &quot;
<unk> laughs .
<unk> .
&quot; Say , that &apos;s a funny place to sleep . &quot;
&quot; Greetings .
I am the Count . &quot;
Don &apos;t worry .
I &apos;ll do something .
<unk> , with a <unk> <unk> .
Eddie , I &apos;m so broke .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m gonna do ... What &apos;s in the needle ?
I don &apos;t know how to make <unk> .
Is there anything I can get you ?
Water ?
A blanket ?
Nah .
This happens all the time ... Should I call a doctor ?
No hospital .
Just take me to the couch ... Let me take you to the hospital .
I didn &apos;t feel well ... Bela , what happened ? !
I gotta type this up , while it &apos;s still fresh !
Ah !
This is very exciting .
No !
&lt; u &gt; Doctor Acula &lt; / u &gt; !
You can still wear the cape , have the fangs ... but you &apos;re a doctor !
Not a count .
<unk> !
Dr. Acula !
They do ?
Shoot .
There &lt; u &gt; must &lt; / u &gt; be a way to get around that ... We can &apos;t .
Those <unk> control the rights .
So let &apos;s make another &quot; Dracula . &quot;
Let &apos;s make &quot; The Return of Dracula &quot; !
Those bastards at Universal .
I made so much money for them , and now I can &apos;t get the time of day .
Hmm ... my biggest hit ?
That would probably be &quot; Dracula . &quot;
But we need to start off with a bang !
Something we &lt; u &gt; know &lt; / u &gt; the audience will want to see .
Mmm .
What was your biggest hit ?
That &apos;s good .
I could use the money .
Sure .
<unk> , that &apos;s great !
To engineer your comeback , we &apos;re gonna need a whole slate of pictures .
Once &quot; Glen Or Glenda &quot; takes off , we &apos;ll slam you into one , then another , then another !
Well ... can &apos;t I play the romantic part ?
I &apos;m tired of always being the bad guy .
You know , back in <unk> , I played Romeo !
I would like to be the lover again -- me , in a boat , with the girl ...
Uh , a cop .
NO !
You play the father .
He &apos;s &lt; u &gt; angry &lt; / u &gt; !
He doesn &apos;t like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn &apos;t like seeing his &lt; u &gt; daughter &lt; / u &gt; behave this way !
Who do I play ?
Eh , forget it .
What else is big ?
<unk> !
<unk> <unk> !
Yeah ... You got the juvenile <unk> , his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks -- But , I don &apos;t like horses .
Do I have to get on one ?
How &apos; bout a <unk> ?
People love <unk> .
<unk> !
I am ready now !
Roll the camera ! !
Look , you seem a little <unk> .
Do you maybe wanna take a little break , go for a nice walk ... and then we &apos;ll come back and shoot the scene ?
Of course !
Dracula requires &lt; u &gt; presence &lt; / u &gt; .
It &apos;s all in the voice , and the eyes , and the hand -- You &apos;re right , Bela .
Now Dracula , &lt; u &gt; that &apos;s &lt; / u &gt; a part that takes acting .
Huh ? !
Oh yeah , of course .
Uh , Eddie , do you have my money ?
Of course !
Well , we got a big day planned for you ... First , we &apos;re gonna start off a little easy , with you in that <unk> over there .
Then , once you &apos;re up to speed and cooking , we &apos;ll <unk> and bring out the laboratory equipment -- I am always on time .
Bela !
It &apos;s so great to see you !
And eight o &apos;clock on the dot .
Right on time !
Yeah .
You pull the strings -- &quot; Pull the strings &quot; ... hey , that &apos;s pretty good !
Ah , so I pull the strings !
Well ... you control everyone &apos;s fate .
You &apos;re like the <unk> .
I don &apos;t understand .
<unk> , your part &apos;s a little different .
You &apos;re like the God that looks down on all the characters , and <unk> everything .
Oh , like <unk> and Hyde !
Ah , I &apos;ve always wanted to play <unk> and Hyde !
I &apos;m looking forward to this production .
Well , It &apos;s about how people have two personalities .
The side they show to the world , and then the secret person they hide inside .
Eddie , what kind of movie is this ?
Yeah , it &apos;s gonna be a great picture !
You &apos;ll love your character !
Bunny , Bela &apos;s here .
Look , hit the bars , work some parties , and get me <unk> !
&lt; u &gt; I need <unk> &lt; / u &gt; !
Eddie , you got a new movie for me ? !
Don &apos;t worry .
I do it every Halloween .
Are you sure this is okay ?
No thank you , Eddie .
I &apos;ll be alright .
Do you want me to get it for you ?
I am getting tired .
I need to take my medicine .
You must be <unk> , and you must be Hungarian .
Vampira , look at me !
<unk> into my eyes .
Hey Bela , how do you do that ?
Vampira !
You will come under my spell !
You will be my slave of love .
I think she &apos;s a honey .
Look at those <unk> .
Ugh !
I hate the way she <unk> the pictures .
She doesn &apos;t show &apos; em the proper respect .
Certainly .
But now the children of the night are calling me .
Well ...
I guess I should go .
Perhaps we could get together again ?
Shh !
I &apos;m coming !
I will feed you !
Take my word for it .
You want to &quot; score &quot; with a young lady , you take her to see &quot; Dracula . &quot;
I never thought of that .
The pure horror , it both <unk> and <unk> them .
Because in their collective <unk> , they have the <unk> of <unk> .
The blood .
The blood is horror .
They were &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; .
They had a poetry to them .
And you know what else ?
The women prefer the traditional monsters .
The old ones were much <unk> .
They had castles , full moons ...
They don &apos;t want the classic horror films anymore .
Today , it &apos;s all giant bugs , giant <unk> , giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense !
No more .
I haven &apos;t worked in four years .
This town , it <unk> you up , then <unk> you out .
I &apos;m just an <unk> .
Make a right .
But you &apos;re a big star !
Back in the old days , yes .
But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela .
Ah , you gotta be <unk> &apos; !
A great man like you ...
I &apos;ll bet you have dozens of &apos; em <unk> up .
I have no next picture .
Boy , Mr. Lugosi , you must lead such an exciting life .
When is your next picture coming out ?
I refuse to drive in this country .
Too many <unk> .
Don &apos;t you <unk> a car ?
Oh , there &apos;s my bus .
Shit , where &apos;s my transfer ? !
I apologize .
When I play Dracula , I put myself into a trance .
It takes me much time to <unk> .
I waited to get your autograph , but you never came outside .
I thought it was great .
You were much <unk> in real life than you were in the movie .
Eh , that was a terrible production .
<unk> was a drunk !
You know , I saw you perform &quot; Dracula . &quot;
In <unk> , in 1938 .
Yes .
I &apos;m <unk> on another <unk> and <unk> truck tour of &quot; Dracula . &quot;
Twelve cities in ten days , if that &apos;s conceivable .
Because I &apos;m planning on dying soon .
Why were you buying a <unk> ?
I don &apos;t want anything .
I &apos;m just a really big , big fan .
I &apos;ve seen all your movies .
Who are you ?
What do you want ?
No .
I don &apos;t work here .
I told you , I don &apos;t want any of your goddamn coffins .
Excuse me , Mr.
Lugosi ? ?
If you say so .
You mean a <unk> coil ?
This is gonna be Bela &apos;s laboratory , so it should be real impressive !
Like one of those mad scientist movies .
I want <unk> , and test tubes , and one of those electrical things that <unk> !
<unk> !
He &apos;s so big !
He &apos;s a &lt; u &gt; monster &lt; / u &gt; !
Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie ?
And once I &apos;m a woman , <unk> and I are getting married -- I &apos;ve never seen anything like him !
Yes !
I &apos;ve dreamed of it for years , but your movie made me realize I &apos;ve got to take action .
<unk> , <unk> !
Jesus !
Are you serious ?
<unk> !
I &apos;m getting my first series of <unk> shots !
And once those babies kick in , they &apos;re gonna remove my organs , and <unk> ME A <unk> !
I dunno .
Lie on the beach ?
Mexico !
And guess what I &apos;m going to do there ? !
I don &apos;t know .
Where ?
So guess where I &apos;m going next weekend ?
No , it &apos;s fine .
It &apos;s real !
In <unk> , Lobo would struggle with that problem every day .
Hey Ed , shouldn &apos;t we do another take ?
Big <unk> kinda got stuck in the doorway .
I mean I can &apos;t see the difference .
I &apos;m <unk> .
But I like the dark gray one .
What do you mean ?
Which one &lt; u &gt; is &lt; / u &gt; the red one ?
Um , okay ... roll camera What &apos;s to protect ?
It was perfect !
Don &apos;t you want a second take , for protection ?
And , CUT !
<unk> IT !
LET &apos;S MOVE ON !
<unk> , <unk> !
<unk> <unk> !
NO !
It has to be <unk> !
This is kind of a <unk> You don &apos;t understand !
The octopus is supposed to live in a &lt; u &gt; lake &lt; / u &gt; !
You &lt; u &gt; can &apos;t sit &lt; / u &gt; !
You gotta walk around , with good <unk> .
You want these people to think we have class .
Otherwise they &apos;ll &lt; u &gt; never &lt; / u &gt; invest in our movie .
These shoes are <unk> .
What do you think you &apos;re doin &apos; ? !
Nothin &apos; !
I told him he was great .
What happened ? !
Jesus , Connie , what did you do ?
Absolutely !
It &apos;s just the beginning .
I promise this : If we stick together , one day I &apos;ll make every single one of you famous .
You really think so ?
This is the big moment ... !
I got the early edition !
It was just dropped off at the <unk> .
Yeah .
It seems a little crazy , but sometimes &lt; u &gt; you just know &lt; / u &gt; .
She &apos;s perfect for me .
Edward , are you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
I told you , the octopus is made of rubber .
This is a piece o &apos; cake .
Incidentally , you &lt; u &gt; promise &lt; / u &gt; you &apos;re not going to scratch my car ... ?
My pleasure .
I &apos;m always happy to assist in a little <unk> .
Cris , you made it .
Thanks a lot .
Bravo !
Bravo !
<unk> !
Eddie , we &apos;re in show <unk> !
It &apos;s all about <unk> .
<unk> .
If you dress nice and talk well , people will swallow anything .
It &apos;s that easy ?
There &apos;s no such thing as a psychic .
People believe my <unk> because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo .
I made it up .
It &apos;s horseshit !
I don &apos;t understand .
Hey Cris , how &apos;d you know we &apos;d be living on Mars by <unk> ?
How &apos;d you know it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , or even <unk> ?
I &apos;m <unk> .
I know all .
<unk> &apos;d you know ? !
Ah .
The director of &quot; Glen Or Glenda . &quot;
Edward Wood , Sir .
And who may you be ?
Look , he doesn &apos;t have any money ... but I &apos;ll give you everything I &apos;ve got .
I have a few hundred dollars .
No .
They say his <unk> ran out years ago .
We thought Mr. Lugosi was <unk> though the Screen <unk> Guild .
We &apos;ll do our best .
Will he be okay ?
Well ... there &apos;s a lot of junk in his system for such an old man .
Apparently , he was addicted to morphine , tried to kick it , and got <unk> to <unk> .
Excuse me .
Doctor ?
I &apos;m with Mr. Lugosi .
How is he ?
Ed ...
I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie .
Now that it &apos;s done , so am I.
But you used to say -- I &apos;m tired of living on the fringe .
Did you really mean those things you said .. ?
Ed , it &apos;s over .
I need a normal life .
Dolores , I got five days to shoot this movie .
Quit kidding around .
But what &apos;s our relationship ?
Are we good friends , or is she just a casual <unk> ?
Oh .
Er ... well you &apos;re the file clerk .
You &apos;re <unk> into the next room , when you bump into Janet .
Eddie , what &apos;s &lt; u &gt; my &lt; / u &gt; <unk> ?
Hey , &lt; u &gt; the movie &apos;s getting made &lt; / u &gt; .
That &apos;s the main thing .
Wood <unk> .
The mark of quality .
None .
But his dad gave me fifty grand .
Oh really ?
How much money did he put up ?
That &apos;s Tony <unk> .
He &apos;s playing Lieutenant Dick Craig .
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here .
Say , who &apos;s the <unk> ?
Of course I &apos;m here .
Today is the file clerk &apos;s big scene .
Honey , you made it !
I wasn &apos;t sure you got my message .
Does she have room for me ?
I &apos;m going to my mother &apos;s .
So WHAT ? ?
Look , we gotta figure out where we &apos;re gonna stay .
You &apos;re a fuckin &apos; mess .
&lt; u &gt; I didn &apos;t dump you &lt; / u &gt; !
Get it through your skull -- I just <unk> the part !
That &apos;s a good reason to dump your girlfriend .
Look , how many times can I say I &apos;m sorry ?
I blew it !
I thought she was rich .
That &apos;s <unk> .
Why would a bit player impress a <unk> ?
Maybe if you &apos;d come to the backers party , I would &apos;ve gotten the money .
I told you this was gonna happen .
The secretary .
Or the file clerk .
But there &apos;s plenty of other parts .
I wanted you to say , &quot; No !
I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores . &quot;
I &apos;m sorry !
What did you want me to say ?
Who do you think &apos;s been paying the rent ? !
Who helped type your script , and did all your grunt work ? !
It was the only way I could get the movie made !
All I know is , ever since &quot; Glen Or Glenda , &quot; all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes !
Dolores , don &apos;t you understand ?
I &apos;m a director now !
I made &quot; Glen Or Glenda . &quot;
Directing &lt; u &gt; is &lt; / u &gt; my day job .
Don &apos;t get angry at me .
Maybe you just need a day job .
That &apos;s the problem !
&lt; u &gt; Nobody &lt; / u &gt; cares about my movie !
I &apos;m tryin &apos; so hard , I don &apos;t know what else to do !
Ed , the landlord doesn &apos;t care .
Tell him &quot; Bride &quot; is in <unk> production .
Ed , the landlord called again .
He wants his money .
Well maybe you &apos;re not studio kind of material .
Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself .
All I wanna do is tell stories .
The things I find interesting ... Bela needs a job ...
I can &apos;t even get a film going ...
But &lt; u &gt; of course &lt; / u &gt; I can &apos;t -- I made the worst movie of all time .
Ed , it &apos;s just one man &apos;s opinion !
I &apos;m no good .
Toss us out on our ass .
Look on the bright side .
If we miss the rent , what &apos;s the worst they can do ?
But &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; do !
And anyway , I &apos;ve got tons of new scripts .
And now that I have a track record , studios are bound to hire me !
But Ed , we &apos;re not even married .
And you don &apos;t have a job .
Who cares ? !
We &apos;re on a <unk> !
These are the moments in life you &apos;re supposed to grab .
I don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s so much money ... From today on , our lives are different !
We &apos;ll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean <unk> did .
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses .
Ed , who is Daniel Davis ?
Say it a little louder .
I don &apos;t think Bela heard you in his trailer .
Ed , this isn &apos;t the real world !
You &apos;ve surrounded yourself with <unk> !
Hon &apos; , nobody &apos;s bothered but you .
Look around -- they couldn &apos;t care less .
How can you just walk around like that , in front of all these people ?
Oh , just like in the script !
It takes me comfortable .
&lt; u &gt; That &apos;s not the issue &lt; / u &gt; ! !
Ugh !
How can you act so casual , when you &apos;re dressed like that ? !
It &apos;s a damn good role .
Oh !
You got nerve , buddy .
Of course it is .
And that &apos;s why you should play the part .
And what about this so-called &quot; Barbara &quot; character ?
It &apos;s obviously ME !
I &apos;m so embarrassed !
This is &lt; u &gt; our &lt; / u &gt; &lt; u &gt; life &lt; / u &gt; !
What , by putting it in a fuckin &apos; script , for everyone to see ? !
What kind of sick mind would operate like that ?
This is my way of telling you -- Jesus Christ !
And you never told me ?
Since I was a kid .
My mom wanted a girl , so she used to dress me in <unk> clothing .
It just kinda became a habit .
How long have you been doing this ?
Well , I &apos;d really like to know what you think .
Why don &apos;t you go in the bedroom and take a look at it ?
I &apos;ll Wait ... Ed , I &apos;m so proud !
I &apos;ll read it as soon as I get home .
So did you get his autograph ?
It &apos;s a shame .
He &apos;s such a rest actor , and nobody uses him anymore .
Boy , I can &apos;t even remember the last time he was in a picture .
No !
He &apos;s very alive .
Well ... sort of .
He &apos;s old , and <unk> -- but he &apos;s still Bela Lugosi !
And he &apos;s really nice .
I thought he was dead .
Oh , the hell with you .
I met <unk> <unk> !
You met Basil <unk> !
Close !
The &lt; u &gt; other &lt; / u &gt; one !
No !
A horror movie star !
Who ?
Robert Taylor ? !
Yeah !
I met a movie star !
Somebody &lt; u &gt; really big &lt; / u &gt; !
Better than not getting a job ?
Huh ? !
Oh , uh , no , I didn &apos;t get the job .
But something &lt; u &gt; better &lt; / u &gt; happened !
You got the job ? ! !
Sweetie , you won &apos;t believe it !
I &apos;ve got the most incredible news !
Aw , er , it &apos;s just a bunch of hot air .
I had to say something to get in the door .
Eddie , I don &apos;t understand .
Why are &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; the most qualified director for the <unk> <unk> Story ?
I know ...
But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it &apos;s gonna get ... Ed , you &apos;re still young .
This is the part of your life when you &apos;re &lt; u &gt; supposed &lt; / u &gt; to be struggling .
Orson Welles was <unk> when he made &quot; Citizen Kane . &quot;
I &apos;m already 30 !
Ed , it was only one review .
Honey , what if I &apos;m wrong ?
What if I just don &apos;t have it ?
The ghost can be <unk> .
&lt; u &gt; Give &lt; / u &gt; &lt; u &gt; me your shoes &lt; / u &gt; !
Dolores , give me your shoes .
You <unk> .
I gave you everything I have in the world : Three-hundred dollars .
The other <unk> you said you &apos;d give me .
What other <unk> ?
Yeah .
Well I need the other <unk> .
What are you looking at me like that for ?
I already gave you my three hundred .
I kinda need it now .
Well then you should pay him , shouldn &apos;t you ?
Sorry to bother you while we &apos;re shooting , but the guy who owns the stage needs his money .
I don &apos;t know .
Hey Bill , which dress is better for you , the green or the red one ?
Eddie , which dress do you like better ?
Hmm .
Those sound kind of small .
Oh , here &apos;s one that looks good : Janet <unk> .
I &apos;d sure like to play her .
Oh , of course ! !
There &apos;s a couple characters you &apos;d be perfect for : The secretary at the newspaper office , or the file clerk !
Oh my , this is very interesting .
Say ... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts ?
Perhaps you &apos;d like to look at the <unk> .
That &apos;s all ? ?
That seems very reasonable for an entire picture .
For this one , we need $ <unk> .
Perhaps a small amount of money .
How much do one of your motion pictures cost ?
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in <unk> in a motion picture .
Yes .
Hollywood is oh so exciting .
I understand you just moved here ?
Pleased to meet you .
I &apos;m Loretta King .
Well , uh , if I could I would ...
He &apos;s so great , &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; hire him .
That &apos;s not true -- Yeah ?
Well now he &apos;s a junkie .
He don &apos;t deserve to work .
No he &apos;s not !
Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years ?
&quot; Dracula &quot; !
&quot; The <unk> &quot; !
&quot; The Black Cat &quot; !
He &apos;s a &lt; u &gt; bum &lt; / u &gt; .
Sure thing , Mr. <unk> .
Hey big shot , get off your ass .
They need a <unk> palm over in the Carl <unk> Building .
Ah !
<unk> Age stuff , huh ?
I like it .
I &apos;ll tell you what , Mr. Ward .
Why don &apos;t you leave those film cans , and my associates and I will take a look at your little <unk> .
Maybe we can do business together .
Well ...
I &apos;ve got another project I wasn &apos;t gonna tell you about .
Lugosi &apos;s in it , but he &apos;s got a smaller part .
The lead is an <unk> , a <unk> young actress named Dolores <unk> .
The title is &quot; Bride Of The Atom . &quot;
Lugosi &apos;s <unk> .
What else you got ?
But Bela Lugosi &apos;s in it !
Oh , &quot; Dr.
Acula . &quot;
I get it .
I don &apos;t like it .
Doctor Acula ?
I don &apos;t get it .
Well , Mr. Feldman , I don &apos;t believe in thinking small .
So I &apos;ve got a whole slate of pictures for you : &quot; The <unk> &apos;s <unk> , &quot; &quot; The Ghoul Goes West &quot; ... and &quot; Doctor Acula &quot; !
I can &apos;t wait to take a look .
So what &apos;s up next ?
Nobody in town has seen it , so I &apos;m givin &apos; you first crack at my talents .
Screen <unk> ?
Hmm , don &apos;t know them .
I just made this picture , over at Screen <unk> .
It opens next week .
Really ? !
Well good for you .
Well , Mr. Feldman , some people have <unk> to show .
I &apos;ve got my own movie .
So what are you bringing me ?
Looks like you got some film cans .
Wood ?
Ward ?
Wood .
Hey , what do you know .
It &lt; u &gt; is &lt; / u &gt; Wood .
<unk> secretaries , you can never get a good one .
Right ?
It &apos;s Wood .
Ed Wood .
Mr. Ward , it &apos;s a delight to meet you .
We are gonna finish this film &lt; u &gt; just &lt; / u &gt; &lt; u &gt; the way I want it &lt; / u &gt; !
Because you can &apos;t compromise an artist &apos;s vision !
Oh , you wanna talk about the &quot; big picture &quot; ? !
How &apos; bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight , but now it &apos;s suddenly night ? ? ?
People won &apos;t notice .
<unk> isn &apos;t about <unk> details -- it &apos;s about the big picture .
That cardboard <unk> <unk> over .
This graveyard is obviously phony !
I like to think so .
&quot; Perfect &quot; ?
Mr. Wood , do you know &lt; u &gt; anything &lt; / u &gt; about the art of film production ? !
And <unk> .
CUT !
Look , Lugosi is dead and Vampira won &apos;t talk .
<unk> to give &lt; u &gt; somebody &lt; / u &gt; the dialogue .
What &apos;d you give him all the lines for ? ?
He &apos;s <unk> !
It &apos;s plenty !
It &apos;s the <unk> that will grow a great oak .
I &apos;ll just find a double to finish his scenes , and we &apos;ll release it as &quot; Bela Lugosi &apos;s <unk> <unk> &quot; Just , it doesn &apos;t look like very much .
Yes , but I &apos;ve got the last footage he ever shot !
&lt; u &gt; Lugosi &lt; / u &gt; ? ? !
Didn &apos;t be pass on ?
Yeah , well we &apos;ve GOT a big star !
Bela Lugosi ! !
Um , I understand that this science <unk> is popular -- but don &apos;t the big hits always have big stars ?
It &apos;s a guaranteed <unk> !
I don &apos;t know ... this is all a lot to <unk> .
From outer space !
It &apos;s <unk> fiction .
&lt; u &gt; Very &lt; / u &gt; big with the kids !
If you make this picture , you &apos;ll have enough money to finance a <unk> religious films !
&lt; u &gt; And &lt; / u &gt; pay my back rent from the profits .
<unk> from &lt; u &gt; what &lt; / u &gt; ? ?
&quot; <unk> From <unk> Space &quot; !
It &apos;s &lt; u &gt; money in the bank &lt; / u &gt; .
Absolutely !
You see this script .. ?
Would that work ?
Okay -- you know what you do ?
You produce a film in a <unk> proven <unk> .
And after it &apos;s a hit , you take the profits from &lt; u &gt; that &lt; / u &gt; , and make the twelve <unk> &apos; movies .
Oh !
Our church has the money for one film .
We just don &apos;t have it for all twelve ... <unk> money is tough .
&lt; u &gt; I &apos;m &lt; / u &gt; interested in the picture business .
My associates and I wish to produce a series of <unk> religious films , on the <unk> .
But unfortunately , we don &apos;t have enough money .
You could say that -- Hmm , so you &apos;re in the picture business ?
I &apos;m real sorry .
My <unk> must have transferred the wrong account ... C &apos;mon in , I &apos;ll write you another one .
Mr. Wood , you have <unk> your third and final rent check .
Mr. Wood , this is Mr. Reynolds , your landlord .
Could you please open up ?
What is happening ?
Don &apos;t worry .
We &apos;re almost there .
My eyes are <unk> me .
Forget her !
Move on .
A good <unk> boy like you as you can have any girl you wish .
But I thought me and Dolores had something .
My friend , you <unk> Greta is first woman I ever see ?
No !
Many <unk> , before I find her .
Nonsense !
You must try our hot <unk> .
Tor , I should be getting home .
Don &apos;t worry .
You just haven &apos;t met right woman yet .

That <unk> goes right through me .
I &apos;d be happy too , if I had such a great family .
The food will make you feel <unk> .
Look at me -- I &apos;m da happiest guy I know !
Uh , I don &apos;t have much of an appetite lately .
Hey !
You &apos;re not <unk> .
Here &apos;s the scene .
Loretta , you &apos;re in a trance .
You <unk> in and get on the operating table .
Now Tor , you &apos;re supposed to tie her down .
But you have an angora fetish ... and when you rub that <unk> of angora , it makes you refuse so Bela has to <unk> you .
But Greta say -- Tor , dialogue is overrated .
You look at the classic film actors , who are they ?
Fairbanks .
<unk> .
They didn &apos;t talk !
They did it all with their face .
Bela , he talk .
Loretta , she talk .
But Tor , he no talk .
But Tor , it &apos;s a <unk> part !
You &apos;re second billed .
No .
She <unk> Lobo is waste of my time .
Lobo don &apos;t talk .
Really ?
Was the third act too intense ?
<unk> !
I haf question &apos; bout script .
My <unk> Greta , she read .
And she no like .
Hopefully , very soon .
I &apos;m just <unk> the final okay from Mr. Feldman at <unk> .
I like .
When do movie shoot ?
So anyway , I &apos;ve got this new script , &quot; Bride Of The Atom , &quot; and there &apos;s a part you &apos;re ideal for : &quot; Lobo . &quot;
He &apos;s tough .
A <unk> .
But he has a heart -- and at the end he <unk> the girl .
Nah , that doesn &apos;t matter !
It &apos;s a visual medium .
But what bout accent ?
Some people <unk> I haf too much accent .
Well , I think you &apos;d be a <unk> in pictures .
No .
With hair , yah .
But I must shave head for <unk> .
It scare da <unk> .
<unk> like that .
I think you &apos;re quite handsome .
Mm , not <unk> enough .
Tor .
Have you ever thought about becoming an actor ?
So , Mr. Johnson -- Oh , of course !
Could we <unk> to table ?
Da pleasure be mine .
Glad you could fit me in your schedule .
It is when it works .
You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch ?
&quot; Kane . &quot;
The studio hated it ... but they didn &apos;t get to touch a frame .
Ed , <unk> are worth fighting for .
Why spend your life making someone else &apos;s dreams ?
Mr. Welles , is it all worth it ?
Tell me about it .
I &apos;m supposed to do a <unk> at Universal , and they want <unk> <unk> to play a &lt; u &gt; Mexican &lt; / u &gt; !
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn &apos;t even &lt; u &gt; matter &lt; / u &gt; if they &apos;re right for the part !
Ugh , I hate when that happens .
Ain &apos;t that the truth !
I &apos;ve even bad <unk> <unk> my movies -- It &apos;s the damn money men .
You never know who &apos;s a <unk> , and who &apos;s got the <unk> .
And then they all think &lt; u &gt; they &apos;re &lt; / u &gt; a director ...
I can &apos;t believe it .
These sound like &lt; u &gt; my &lt; / u &gt; problems !
Eh , the financing just fell through for the third time on &quot; Don <unk> . &quot;
So I &apos;m trying to finish a <unk> for something else .
But I can &apos;t find the <unk> -- I think I left it in <unk> .
Oh .
Um , I &apos;m Ed Wood !
So , what are you working on now ?
My pleasure .
I &apos;m Orson Welles .
Uh , uh , I &apos;m a young <unk> , and a really big fan ... and I just wanted to meet you .
Excuse me , Sir ... ?
&quot; Your movie &quot; ? !
I wish it was your movie !
I wish I hadn &apos;t blown every dime I ever made into this <unk> .
If I ever see you again , I &apos;ll kill you ! ! !
You can &apos;t talk that way about my movie .
Screw you , Wood !
I even sunk more money into different titles : &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; He Or She ? &quot;
&quot; I <unk> Two Lives &quot; ...
It <unk> &apos;T <unk> !
Nobody wants to see the piece of shit .
Maybe it needs special handling .
Because I can &apos;t sell it to save my life !
You made a goddamn <unk> fish .
Is it an art film , a horror show , a hygiene <unk> ?
Nobody knows !
I &apos;m <unk> &apos; people to book it .
&quot; Where &apos;s the <unk> &quot; ? !
The <unk> are in Alabama , <unk> , and <unk> !
You schmuck , it ain &apos;t gonna play L.A. !
I did .
I <unk> some tits and ass .
Georgie , what &apos;s with the <unk> footage ? ?
You said you were cutting in &lt; u &gt; establishing shots &lt; / u &gt; !
Yeah ? ?
Well Orson Welles didn &apos;t wear angora sweaters , did he ? ? !
But I &apos;m proud .
I wrote , directed , and <unk> in it just like Orson Welles in &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; !
And you did a <unk> job , too .
But you don &apos;t want other <unk> to know that &apos;s you in drag .
Trust me .
It &apos;s a career killer .
Why ? !
I did all those things !
Hell , I even built the props .
Good .
And one more thing .
I think your &quot; <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> Ed Wood &quot; credit is a bad idea .
Um , I guess -- They &apos;ll notice .
Look , why don &apos;t you let me take over from here ?
I can do a few tricks : <unk> it out with more stock footage , add establishing shots ... Gee , I used every frame of film we shot .
Maybe they won &apos;t notice .
Ed , what was the one thing I asked you to do ?
Make it &lt; u &gt; seven reels long &lt; / u &gt; .
I &apos;ve got contracts with my <unk> .
If it ain &apos;t over an hour , they won &apos;t play it .
Yeah ?
Whatever .
So did you like it ?
I think it &apos;s <unk> minutes long .
I know a guy in Universal &apos;s stock house -- he &apos;s giving me the footage for free .
This movie &apos;s gonna look like a million bucks .
&lt; u &gt; Then how &apos;s it gonna get in the &lt; / u &gt; &lt; u &gt; picture &lt; / u &gt; ? !
Don &apos;t worry .
We &apos;re not gonna film any of it .
Ed !
What &apos;s with these <unk> pages ? !
A scene in a <unk> factory ?
A <unk> <unk> ? ?
&lt; u &gt; Three-hundred soldiers <unk> <unk> &lt; / u &gt; &lt; u &gt; Beach &lt; / u &gt; ? ? !
What &apos;s going on here ?
I can &apos;t afford to film this nonsense !
So change the poster .
Trust me , you &apos;ll be better off .
This is a story that &apos;s gonna &lt; u &gt; grab &lt; / u &gt; people .
It &apos;s about this guy .
He &apos;s crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses .
Should he tell her ?
Should he not tell her ?
He &apos;s torn .
George , this is <unk> .
And what &apos;s with this new title ? !
My poster says &quot; I <unk> MY <unk> &quot; !
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s a schmuck .
Yeah !
Five pages right before it ends !
The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters .
There &apos;s still a <unk> -- I thought this was gonna be a <unk> change film !
Because he &apos;s &lt; u &gt; my friend &lt; / u &gt; .
Why would Lugosi want to be in a <unk> <unk> ?
Uh , yeah .
Our picture .
No , he &apos;s not dead !
He lives in <unk> Hills .
I met him recently , and he wants to be in our picture .
Isn &apos;t he dead ?
What if I told you you could have a star for $ <unk> ? ?
Fine , maybe you &apos;re right .
But it doesn &apos;t friggin &apos; matter .
I can &apos;t afford a star , so I don &apos;t even know what we &apos;re talking about .
No !
It would be something better !
Something &lt; u &gt; impressive &lt; / u &gt; .
The biggest <unk> you &apos;ve ever had !
Yeah .
<unk> with a star .
Yeah , but if you took that crap and put a star in it , you &apos;d have something !
Eddie , you must have me confused with David <unk> .
I don &apos;t make major motion pictures .
I make crap .
No .
Better than tits -- a &lt; u &gt; star &lt; / u &gt; !
Mr. Weiss , I was thinkin &apos; about what you said , about how all your movies have to make a profit .
And I realized , what &apos;s the one thing , that if you put in a movie , it &apos;ll be successful ? ?
Yeah .
I know what it &apos;s like to live with a secret , and worry about what people are gonna think of you ... My girlfriend still doesn &apos;t know why her sweaters are always <unk> out .
And this is why you think you &apos;re the most qualified to make my movie ?
<unk> , I even <unk> wearing a <unk> and panties .
I &apos;ll tell ya , I wasn &apos;t scared of being killed , but I was &lt; u &gt; terrified &lt; / u &gt; of getting <unk> , and having the medics discover my secret .
You gotta be kiddin &apos; me .
Nah , I &apos;m all man .
I even fought in <unk> .
&apos;Course , I &lt; u &gt; was &lt; / u &gt; wearing ladies &apos; <unk> under my uniform .
So you &apos;re not a fruit ?
No , no , not at all !
I &lt; u &gt; love &lt; / u &gt; women .
<unk> their clothes makes me feel closer to them .
Are you a fruit ?
Well , Mr. Weiss , I &apos;ve never told anyone what I &apos;m about to tell you ... but I really want this job .
I like to dress in women &apos;s clothing .
Hmm .
There &apos;s five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing .
You said on the phone you had some kind of &quot; special <unk> . &quot;
Well , Mr. Weiss , I &apos;m your guy .
I work fast , and I &apos;m a deal : I write AND direct .
And I &apos;m good .
I just did a play in Hollywood , and Victor <unk> <unk> its realism .
It opens in nine weeks in <unk> .
Fuck no !
But there &apos;s a poster .
Is there a script ?
No , of <unk> I &apos;m gonna make the movie !
I &apos;ve already <unk> <unk> sold Alabama and <unk> .
Those repressed <unk> really go for that twisted pervert stuff .
So we &apos;ll just make it without that <unk> .
We &apos;ll <unk> it .
So you &apos;re not gonna make the movie ?
Yeah , well a couple of things have changed .
It ain &apos;t gonna be the <unk> <unk> story no more .
Goddamn &quot; <unk> &quot; printed the story before I had the rights , and now that bitch is asking for the sky .
Yes , I &apos;m Ed Wood .
I &apos;m here about directing the <unk> <unk> picture .
Can I help you ?
So ?
It &apos;s only a <unk> drive .
And it &apos;ll probably clear up , once we hit the desert .
Heck , it &apos;ll probably clear up once we drive around the corner .
I promise .
But it &apos;s pouring .
And the car top is stuck !
&lt; u &gt; Right now &lt; / u &gt; .
Let &apos;s drive to Vegas !
Let &apos;s get married .
Ed , I &apos;m so happy for you .
C &apos;mon !
Let &apos;s just go .
Ed , you &apos;re gonna miss your own <unk> .
I can &apos;t get it to go up .
Who &apos;s Dr. Tom ?
Look , it &apos;s Dr. Tom .
Hey , Dr. Tom !
Hell , if I did , I wouldn &apos;t have any friends .
You should feel lucky .
Ed &apos;s the only guy in town who doesn &apos;t pass judgment on people .
Yeah ...
I should give her a call .
The poor girl &apos;s out of a job .
Yes !
<unk> !
<unk> energy !
Oh that &apos;s gonna seem so scientific .
This movie &apos;s gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film .
&lt; u &gt; No <unk> &lt; / u &gt; .
No , <unk> !
What &apos;s the biggest energy ? ?
No .
They &apos;re beyond that !
They &apos;re smarter than the humans .
What &apos;s &lt; u &gt; more &lt; / u &gt; advanced ?
Uh , atomic energy ?
The left .
It &apos;s more natural .
Hey , I &apos;ve got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb .
What would that be made of ?
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right ?
You know , when you rewrite a script , it just gets better and better !
I was a fuckin &apos; <unk> !
I let people <unk> the movies , cast their relatives ...
I let Bela down ... Well you tried -- I might as well be .
I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see .
I blew it .
All he wanted was a comeback ... that last glory ... Ed , you &apos;ve got to snap out of this .
Bela &apos;s dead -- &lt; u &gt; you &apos;re not &lt; / u &gt; !
I &apos;d seen him in a <unk> so many times , I expected him to jump out ... What was that ?
Thanks .
It &apos;s actually the only thing I know how to make .
Hey , can you grab that <unk> ?
Ed , this spaghetti sauce is delicious .
No !
I love sex with girls .
Does this mean you don &apos;t like sex with girls ?
I like to wear women &apos;s clothes : <unk> , <unk> , sweaters , pumps ... it &apos;s just something I do .
And I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m telling you , but I really like you , and I don &apos;t want it getting in the way down the road .
Kathy , I &apos;m about to tell you something I &apos;ve never told any girl on a first date .
But I think it &apos;s important that you know .
I like to wear women &apos;s clothes .
A few years ago , I actually saw him do &quot; Dracula &quot; live .
I thought he was much <unk> in person .
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month .
But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that .
That &lt; u &gt; is &lt; / u &gt; incredible !
You know , I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie .
What do you mean ?
You &apos;re not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw .
Your friend &apos;s .
Yeah !
Don &apos;t forget &quot; <unk> Theatre &quot; ... And then every Saturday , I &apos;d go to the little movie theater down the street .
I even started <unk> there .
Oh .
I loved those shows !
&quot; Inner <unk> &quot; ... &quot; The <unk> &quot; -- Nah , &apos; cause I had my comic books .
And I read <unk> magazines .
And I listened to the radio <unk> ... Did you find it boring ?
Sounds like you lived in <unk> Corners .
No .
I &apos;m from back east .
You know , <unk> small town ... everybody knew everybody , I was a Boy Scout , my dad worked for the post office ...
So have you always lived in L.A. ?
They &apos;re very nice .
Let me get my coat .
I just picked them up on the way over ... Oh , flowers !
I didn &apos;t know you were so traditional .
He &apos;s better .
Thank you for asking .
How &apos;s your friend ?
I am .
How &apos;s your father ?
You look beat .
Oh , it &apos;s you again .
This is my thirteenth pair .
How long &apos;s he been here ?
<unk> for my father .
He gets cold in this hospital .
What are you making ?
Oh .
My <unk> .
The marriage already ended .
I got married last night .
Hello .
You &apos;re sleeping in a tuxedo .
LOOK AT <unk> <unk> !
Exactly .
Hey , how &apos; bout this -- what if I don &apos;t have any lines ?
I &apos;ll do the part <unk> !
You don &apos;t wanna be noticed ?
Look ... would it be possible to make the &quot; Ghoul &apos;s Wife &quot; a little less <unk> , so people won &apos;t really notice me in the movie ?
The &lt; u &gt; Ghoul &apos;s Wife &lt; / u &gt; ? !
God , I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m doing this ...
I know what &lt; u &gt; that &apos;s &lt; / u &gt; like .
Anyway , I brought a copy of the script .
You would play the &quot; Ghoul &apos;s Wife . &quot;
It &apos;s terrible .
People won &apos;t even return my calls .
It &apos;s like I don &apos;t exist .
I &apos;m really sorry ...
It &apos;s the same film .
But the <unk> wanted a <unk> title .
C &apos;mon !
It &apos;s gonna be a big event -- we &apos;re going all out !
Bela , Tor , and Cris are coming .
You &apos;ll have fun !
Didn &apos;t you just make one called &quot; Bride Of The Atom &quot; ?
No , don &apos;t worry , I moved on .
I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world <unk> of my new film , &quot; Bride Of The <unk> . &quot;
Look buddy , I &apos;m a big star .
I &apos;ve got real offers from real studios .
I don &apos;t need to blow some dentist for a part .
So forget it !
Please !
It &apos;ll only take a minute .
You can have some hors d &apos;oeuvres , and meet my backers !
There &apos;s a really nice dentist from Oxnard ...
Uh , look , I &apos;m with some friends , and we &apos;re about to eat -- No !
I don &apos;t want you to show the movie , I want you to be &lt; u &gt; in it &lt; / u &gt; !
See , maybe I should explain : We started shooting , but then after three days we got shut down .
So we &apos;re having a backers party , to raise some more money .
Perhaps you &apos;d like to come next door and meet some of the backers ... ?
You want me to show it on my TV program ?
Well I got nothing to do with that .
You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven -- No .
I think my film is perfect for you .
I don &apos;t understand .
Do you want my autograph ?
You don &apos;t know me , but my name is Ed Wood .
I &apos;m a film producer .
I &apos;m currently in production on a <unk> piece , with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson .
And I saw you here , and I thought : <unk> !
Excuse me , Miss Vampira ?
That was <unk> .
Paul , you gotta try harder .
I don &apos;t want this film to be <unk> .
This time , we go for the quality .
Well I was thinkin &apos; like , when Bela played &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
Too tall ... too short ... And this guy doesn &apos;t work at all .
Great !
Bring &apos; em in !
Bunny , I gotta run .
Ed , I got the Lugosi <unk> outside .
So how long have you known Eddie ?
Hey , don &apos;t blame me !
You didn &apos;t say anything about no motor when I was up on that <unk> !
You know , to make the legs move -- What octopus motor ?
Hey .
This is looking good !
Paul , where &apos;s the octopus motor ?
YES !
JUST DO IT !
You &apos;re sure this is gonna work ?
Uh , I couldn &apos;t reach the guy ... he was in meetings all day .
But this &apos;ll be great , I promise !
Ed , you said you were getting permission .
Nah , it &apos;ll work .
Where &apos;s Bela ?
We couldn &apos;t afford any more props .
If it seems weird , maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner .
Wow , this lab looks great .
Except why is there a <unk> and refrigerator ?
Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East .
She &apos;s from &quot; old money , &quot; and he thinks she &apos;s loaded .
And here &apos;s the <unk> : She &apos;s &lt; u &gt; very &lt; / u &gt; &lt; u &gt; interested &lt; / u &gt; in the picture business !
Uh , <unk> .
Excuse me !
Sorry to interrupt , but I got some big news .
Here &apos;s to Ed .
For making us into something .
Just like I always promised .
Now you &apos;re among the <unk> .
You &apos;re movie stars .
Well it looks good .
Let &apos;s use it !
I don &apos;t know .
The set doesn &apos;t look right !
It looks too ... empty .
<unk> it up .
Put a skeleton in the corner .
And what &apos;s that thing over there ?
So don &apos;t take it too seriously .
We &apos;re all doin &apos; great work .

Hi , this is Ed Wood .
Hank was always good with the ladies .
Always good-looking .
Hell , he &apos;s been dead for two days , he still looks better than me .
Oh , Al ...
This is just ...
I &apos;m going to be living with my brother .
He &apos;s not in such good shape as I am , but ...
I &apos;m looking forward to the pillow fights .
I &apos;m moving out .
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom ?
Is there anything I can -- It &apos;s your father .
Hank .
Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack .
You thought it was me ?
Where is she ?
Is she all right ?
Our neighbors gave me a ride .
How &apos;s your mother ?
Well , now I will .
He was a crazy mean , son-of-a-bitch .
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father ?
I &apos;m not -- I didn &apos;t -- Al , you know how I feel about you ... <unk> , you &apos;re hurting me .
No .
Only <unk> now .
Now , if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he &apos;d better have killed someone or no one will buy it .
This one to Dr. <unk> .
Well , I don &apos;t think you can get more common than me , Al .
They <unk> the common person .
Yeah , so ... ?
Norman Rockwell .
He painted magazine covers .

A mailman , a boy scout , a kid visiting a doctor ... Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell ?
Look at your face .
I had a car that color .
What do you love her or something ?
She &apos;s in the kitchen .
I &apos;d yell for her , but I &apos;d die .
You had a busy night last night .
Is Mom here ?
I gotta talk to her .
No , I intentionally picked out a lot of crap &apos; cause I don &apos;t like you .
Yeah .
I brought you some movies .
At the point -- I don &apos;t -- Look you &apos;d be on TV maybe one or two times each .
I &apos; 11 try to avoid I &apos; 11 go out of my way to avoid , getting together with you .
Believe me .
At what point ?
No .
<unk> and <unk> , okay , but if it &apos;s actual sex they have to cut away .
No !
Do they show you having sex ?
I &apos; 11 have to pass , Al .
And it &apos;s not an age thing -- I guess -- I don &apos;t -- it &apos;s all in the contract .
There &apos;s this <unk> contract -- Do they show it ?
What if I &apos;m <unk> ?
What <unk> &apos;re <unk> ?
No .
The bathroom is off limits <unk> when I go to sleep they go to other <unk> .
Unless I get up .
Then they go back on the air .
Unless I get up to go to the bathroom , I guess , then - You know it .
Ooh , the sister !
She is hot .
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more .
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed .
That would be great .
You know what would be great ?
She doesn &apos;t give a shit about him .
You think she really likes him ?
So if it &apos;s a show and they have a guy die that &apos;s writing , but if it &apos;s real and they have a guy die that &apos;s murder .
This is real , <unk> !
You know , for a <unk> .
The audience falls in love with this <unk> old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies , it &apos;s ...
They know what they &apos;re doing .
What do you mean &quot; they &apos;re gonna have him die ? &quot;
I &apos; 11 tell you something else .
The old guy in the wheelchair ?
The <unk> ?
They &apos;re gonna have him die .
Okay , I &apos;m nuts .
Her .
That look .
She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother .
Did you see that ?
Yeah .
Because , you didn &apos;t talk me into anything .
Everything you wanted me to do , I wanted to do .
I don &apos;t think so .
Yeah ?
Well I &apos;m not starting now .
No .
You screwed up my life just so you could get higher <unk> .
You never gave a shit about me .
You know , everything you asked me to do I did .
I call you for advice about Shari you say - &quot; Leave her be , see other people for a while . &quot;
You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show .
Yeah , but when they went off people weren &apos;t making fun of them .
They weren &apos;t <unk> !
I &apos;m Pumpkin Ass again !
Ed , everything goes off .
&quot; Cheers &quot; went off .
&quot; <unk> &quot; went off -- <unk> , not <unk> .
Give it some space .
Can I tell you something -- as a friend ?
My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it &apos;s worth .
You said a woman likes to be pursued .
Leave her be .
Yeah , that &apos;s why I called .
I mean , maybe <unk> would tell me where she moved -- Ed , do you want my advice ?
What if Shari &apos;s the dream ?
You asked me if I had a dream .
I said &quot; Sure , I have a dream .
I just don &apos;t know what it is yet . &quot;
Stand back -- I &apos;m about to do my Happy Dance .
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month .
We &apos;re going to get you a <unk> , don &apos;t worry .
Ed , I have some news for you .
We &apos;re picking up Ed TV for another month !
They tore her dress !
... A woman wants to be pursued .
Can I give you one bit of advice ?
About Shari ?
And all the kids <unk> calling me &quot; Pumpkin Ass . &quot;
&quot; Hey Pumpkin Ass , &quot; -- for like a year .
So , now , I feel like everyone &apos;s watching me and , you know , I &apos;m &quot; Pumpkin Ass &quot; again .
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange <unk> pants .
How you doing , Ed ?
Good idea .
Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes ?
Could we just talk alone for a second ?
I -- Don &apos;t say that .
That &apos;s like ... telling a guy before you have sex you &apos;d better be good .
You don &apos;t do that .
I bet my career on you .
You &apos;d better be good .
Now look .
Don &apos;t freeze up on me .
I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed , <unk> quality .
You &apos;re not going to lose that , are you ?
Um , yeah -- thanks .
That has my work number , my home number , my <unk> number .
I sleep three hours a night .
Call me whenever you want to talk .
Off the air , on the air , whenever .
Okay ?
I want you to take this .
Okay , so you understand ?
We &apos;re <unk> a permanent camera in your bedroom , one in the kitchen , one in the living room , plus , of course , there &apos;ll always be a couple of <unk> following you .
Ed , can I see you a second .
Oh , see , studying would &apos;ve been a huge help .
Where were you , then ?
What did you study ?
I &apos;ve got this great idea .
We put together a video .
&quot; The Network <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And listen , i &apos;ve really loved working here .
Where are you going ?
Cynthia , I think you &apos;re <unk> under a <unk> .
You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this , we should be impressed .
We &apos;re not .
Anybody in any business can predict failure .
1 need people who prevent failure .
I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction .
Remember this was your baby .
Isn &apos;t this getting kind of pathetic .
I mean we drank the juice , now we &apos;re just <unk> <unk> .
Let it go !
With all due respect , Cynthia you &apos;re nuts .
I &apos;m giving him another month !
I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s peaked .
Ed TV is an <unk> balloon .
Get it off before it <unk> all over us .
What are you talking about ?
He &apos;s fine .
He &apos;s out of the hospital already .
The <unk> are higher than ever .
Take him off the air .
I &apos;m not sure about the entire concept .
I <unk> my staff .
The men say they &apos;d hang around with him and the women say he &apos;s <unk> .
And one of the men said he &apos;s <unk> .
He &apos;s who we want to go with .
No .
The deceased is ... Henry <unk> .
I thought -- I thought he was dead .
I ... don &apos;t know .
I ... Hotel ?
What were they doing in a hotel ?
According to your mother .
When the <unk> got to the hotel , she told them that -- Really ?
They were ..
Very quick .
Between you and me , it &apos;s not a bad way to go .
Making love to your wife ... it &apos;s very sweet .
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick ?
I &apos;d hate to think he ... Mm ... Oh , man ... Just wait here .
She &apos;s coming right back out .
Thank you .
Can I see her ?
I &apos;m Dr. <unk> .
Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes .
we gave her something to calm her down .
So he killed himself .
And then , uh ... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again .
Yeah , a thing .
He became a big hero .
He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him Oh right , right !
She fell down , like a ... No !

In Texas .
Baby ... Jessica !
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl ?

Oh -- so I &apos;m just , what -- a poor substitute ?

Yeah .
You did good .
What &apos;s wrong ?
Hey , if it &apos;s free , it &apos;s me .
You ready ?
Yeah , what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something ?
Oh , that thing .
Yeah .
Did you hear about this ?
Your brother &apos;s here .
So do I.
So what ?
I &apos;m doing all right .
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says &quot; If you &apos;re over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag , you screwed up your life . &quot;
And I &apos;m laughing and then I realize I wear a <unk> .
I &apos;m gonna stick this right in your eye .
We &apos;re the guys who clean up after the parade .
You know who we are ?
We &apos;re falling behind .
You said that .
Look at this -- people are getting married , they &apos;re getting married ...
I &apos;m a whore !
Your <unk> are filthy !
And how is this helping ?

I &apos;m a tramp Meet your new father .
The whole nation is laughing at us !
Why shouldn &apos;t I be in a place like this ?
I &apos;m a whore !
You &apos;re famous .
Somebody called me .
What are you doing in a place like this ?
Ed !
How did you know I was here ?
Well , he &apos;s the only one in America who doesn &apos;t !
Don &apos;t tell Al .
He doesn &apos;t know .
Apparently , neither can Hank .
What the hell did you do to him ?
Do you think it &apos;s been easy for me ?
It &apos;s been years .
Al can &apos;t have sex .
But Al is your husband now !
One thing led to another .
He was my husband once .
Oh my god !
On TV !
Yes .
He assumed Hank was your husband .
He didn &apos;t know .
To you ?
In front of him ?
With the ...
The doctor said you were having sex .
So you had sex with him ?
Hank !
He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried .
So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in ...
I felt so sorry for him -- It was horrible .
He called me up .
I &apos;m coming right over .
I &apos;ll be right there .
Oh God .
What hospital ?
He &apos;s dead !
Eddie , he &apos;s dead !
It was his heart .
What &apos;s the matter ? !
I &apos;m at the hospital .
What do you think .
I mean about ... him .
Should I just ... have nothing to do with him ?
I mean ... Hank !
All of a sudden .
Because now you &apos;re famous and he can get something from you .
I don &apos;t <unk> you to become a victim like Marcia .
Not that you &apos;re a victim , honey .
You &apos;re not .
Life &apos;s just been a little hard on you , sweetie .
And what did he come back now for ?
If I don &apos;t call you &quot; Dad &quot; it &apos; just because ... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives -- or when I thought you came into our lives -- He had a woman in my own bed !
And how dare you call him &quot; Dad &quot; in front of Al .
This is your father .
This is who was there for you when you needed someone .
Oh my God .
You and Al were - and that &apos;s why you threw him out .
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it &apos;s another thing .
What &apos;s the difference ?
So does Grandma .
So does <unk> O <unk> .
You told me you had a <unk> and he ran off with your nurse .
She had white shoes .
Could &apos;ve been a nurse ?
She could &apos;ve been a nurse .
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse ?
He ... apologized , he begged me .
He can be very ... charming when it suits his purpose .
Chicken <unk> ?
I was six .
He didn &apos;t leave &apos; til I was twelve .
All right -- do you want to know the truth ?
I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister &apos;s on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken <unk> .
So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed .
Okay ?
I don &apos;t care what he says .
Look , I don &apos;t need to <unk> this .
On television !
He says -- He had girlfriends !
Yes to me or yes to the coil ?
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie .
Everything .
I told you the facts !
He abandoned us -- those are the facts .
I &apos;m not !
I &apos;m just trying to get some facts .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re taking his side .
Oh my God ! !
I mean , that worked out .
Oh my God !
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left .
Well , who knows ?
Maybe she finally picked a winner this time .
I don &apos;t know .
She &apos;s living with that &quot; entertainer &quot; ... How &apos;s Marcia ?
She all right ?
No !
I -- All right , look , if you hear from Ray .... tell him to call me , okay ?
I know you .
This Shari is a passing fancy .
No !
And that girl has a name .
No .
Maybe he &apos;s watching .
Tell him you &apos;re sorry .
Tell him you &apos; 11 stay away from that girl .
I don &apos;t want to -- do you know where he is ?
He made a mistake .
Hey , he cheated on her .
Eddie , how could you do it ?
Your brother &apos;s girlfriend .
Ma , do you know where Ray is ?
I &apos;ve been calling him and I &apos;m getting his machine and -- Look , Ma , come on out .
Really .
I need to talk to you .
No .
It &apos;s a mess .
Do you want us to come in the kitchen ?
Send him ?
Ma , I can &apos;t .
it &apos;s -- just come out here .
Please , I -- Send him away .
Yeah .
The camera guy is here .
Are the TV people with you ?
She wouldn &apos;t tell me .
I &apos;m sorry .
Where &apos;d they send her ?
She left .
She moved .
She got <unk> to give her a transfer and she left .
She couldn &apos;t stand it anymore .
We had people , news people , regular people , just sleeping in our hallway , going through our mail , our garbage .
I mean it was she couldn &apos;t take it anymore .
Now I &apos;ve got to move .
I can &apos;t afford this place by myself .
What are you talking about ?
Well , when will she be back ?
What is she , at work ?
Hi .
Is Shari here ?
Shari , Ray feels -- No , I understand .
That &apos;s - where is she , is she all right ?
She really doesn &apos;t want you and the camera in here right now .
Right , yeah -- Everybody &apos;s making audition tapes for that Real TV thing .
What &apos;s going on over there ?
All right .
Let them decide .
Not too good .
That &apos;s why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life , you &apos;re in violation and are liable for the station &apos;s financial losses .
Ed , I urge you to reconsider .
I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so <unk> with yours .
Play fair with them , Ed .
Look , if you don &apos;t let me out of this ...
I &apos; 11 just ...
I &apos; 11 just sit in my apartment all day .
I won &apos;t go anywhere , I won &apos;t do anything .
What kind of show will that be ?
Well , no .
You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to .
The station entered into this on that understanding .
If you had <unk> we &apos;d have <unk> this with somebody else .
You can &apos;t just change the rules in the middle of the game , son .
It &apos;s not fair to us .
More <unk> , it &apos;s not fair to the <unk> .
They &apos;re interested in you .
They &apos;ve devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you .
All right , I &apos; 11 pay for the parking .
Big network !
Well , Ed , that &apos;s ... not really possible .
I can imagine .
You said you wanted nothing to do with this .
You swore to me .
&quot; Don &apos;t come near me .
Don &apos;t bring this into my life ... &quot; Ed , he needs a break .
You don &apos;t know what kind of bad luck he &apos;s had -- Oh !
Oh -- okay , now I get it .
It &apos;s &quot; Star Search . &quot;
You wanted me here because the camera comes with me .
Hm ?
I &apos;m , uh ... Why isn &apos;t this drunken woman you ?
What are you doing ?
Our foibles , our foibles !
They &apos;re gonna mock our foibles .
No !
I barely even mentioned <unk> &apos;s just that , my friends , the people at work , whoever I &apos;m regularly in contact with they want <unk> from .
I can &apos;t do that to him .
He &apos;s pushing a little too hard - but ...
I just can &apos;t do that to him .
Never would be plenty .
How much less ?
He &apos;s just ... trying a little too hard -- It means they hate his freaking guts .
It means if he were on fire they wouldn &apos;t put him out .
What does this mean ?
No , I mean ... Are you asking me ?
Welcome to work , Ed .
Who &apos;s in it ?
Ed , come on .
What &apos;s that gonna do ?
You &apos;re gonna bring <unk> to their knees .
Let me recommend a movie to you .
It &apos;s called &quot; Get your shit together before it &apos;s too late . &quot;
Well , then I &apos;m quitting .
Hey .
I went as far as I felt comfortable .
I mean , you know , let &apos;s face it -- you come and go here as you please .
You work when you feel like it -- you know , Bruce <unk> &apos;s birthday is not a legal holiday .
You <unk> or you <unk> ?
Oh , Christ .
Did you go to bat for me ?
Ed , look , uh ... you &apos;re not getting the job .
They &apos;re gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store .
I &apos;m sorry .
What &apos;s the deal ?
Did anybody make a decision - Um , yeah , I was gonna ...
So act now .
Here &apos;s Ed &apos;s home phone number .
But facts !
They have to be <unk> .
Anything from their past , their present , business , personal -- arrests , affairs ... And whoever comes up with the <unk> , most <unk> material -- I &apos; 11 give you ten thousand dollars .
And you get to be on Ed TV .
Hah ?
My lovely assistant , Shari .
I &apos;m glad you asked .
The contest is who can dig up -- legally , of course -- I &apos;m not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American <unk> System which owns Real TV .
What do we have to do ?
Let &apos;s have a contest .
Now this would mostly be open to professional <unk> and detectives .
But anyone can join in .
My truck <unk> , so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt .
So I had to get a haircut .
What did you do to your hair ?
You weren &apos;t able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any man , I admit -- and my problem is , if I think I &apos;m losing , I pull myself out of the game .
I bail .
See ?
I told you , I &apos;m the love coroner .
It &apos;s what I do .
I yell &quot; Geronimo &quot; and jump out of a relationship .
This is going right up your ass .
Well , yeah , everybody &apos;s someone .
But I mean someone they want to be .
I mean let &apos;s face it , I &apos;m working in the video store , no one &apos;s coming in saying &quot; oh , I wish I was that guy .
1 wish was <unk> that huge pile of tapes . &quot;
At least for a month I &apos;m not just a guy with a name tag .
I &apos;m famous .
You see how people look at me .
Like when they ask for my autograph or say &quot; Hi &quot; to me ...
It &apos;s like I &apos;m a basketball player or a ... you know , like I &apos;m someone .
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don &apos;t get if I <unk> -- it &apos;s too complicated .
I -- Besides ... No .
If I quit I don &apos;t get the balloon payment .
No ... Could you ?
What do you want me to do ?
You want me to quit the show ? !
No .
It &apos;s your fault .
It &apos;s not their fault .
Oh that was ... no , I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride .
It &apos;s you .
I want you .
Yeah ...
I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show .
She lied to me .
I mean all my life , she &apos;s telling me one story and then ... it turns out to be a completely different story .
Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth .
No .
Not in my house .
The truth is a stranger .
And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are .
Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - &quot; How do they find me &quot; she says .
Ray <unk> on you and then <unk> me for it .
I &apos;m the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself ... Oh , man ... Are you all right ?
Are you all right ?
I need to talk .
Just ... just relax .
Okay ?
We won &apos;t do anything .
We &apos; 11 just sit here for a while .
I feel like a criminal or , like we &apos;re cheating on someone .
Come on , let &apos;s go .
Oh <unk> -- couldn &apos;t he sleep with Rita ?
We &apos; 11 all have a good time .
So my little brother &apos;s staying here .
I &apos;m sleeping with Rita .
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City .
There &apos;s a list .
Exactly .
Boy , you &apos;re smart .
Why are you so mean to her ?
What did she do to you ?
&quot; Is she good enough for Ed ? &quot;
Who the hell am I ?
Who the hell do you think I should be dating ?
Who cares ?
I don &apos;t <unk> -- No .
I do care .
Shame on everybody .
Shame on you !
Well , just the <unk> percent .
The other ... A <unk> .
&quot; Is Shari Good Enough for Ed ? &quot;
<unk> per cent said &quot; no . &quot;
They hate me !
<unk> three of the Post .
Look at this .
Everybody hates me !
I have no privacy .
Even now !
I &apos;m crying and I can &apos;t stop and they won &apos;t go away .
And now it &apos;s going to be another month !
Ed ...
I think we should stop seeing each other .
... yeah , then , but ... ... if this ... ... weren &apos;t here ... ?
I really like you too ... Shari , I really like you ...
I know , I ...
So ?
What do they think -- we &apos;re not kids -- I know , but even if they go away , everybody in America knows what we &apos;re doing because ... they went away .
I told you .
If we ... you know do it , they go away until ... we &apos;re done .
He could give me some oxygen .
I wish my <unk> was here .
Saturday , I think we should Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks .
We get a big family audience on <unk> so it works out .
It &apos;s quite an honor .
Will you come with me ?
You know , the big machine that <unk> the ice .
Sunday night at the <unk> game , I &apos;m driving the <unk> .
You should see the one we wear when it rains .
It &apos;s really a tremendous <unk> .
You know , I never saw you in your uniform before .
I missed you .
What are you doing ?
Weird ?
If this happened last month it would &apos;ve been weird .
Now with ... the TV and ... now it &apos;s just too weird .
Oh God , this is so weird .
Me too .
I mean I &apos;m going out with Ray and I &apos;m ... thinking about you .
Yeah .
I mean for months I &apos;ve been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend ...
But , you know , what could I do ?
All right .
Okay .
I &apos; 11 ... see you .
Can &apos;t we just -- Well , when you put it that way .
I kissed my boyfriend &apos;s brother on television !
Oh my God .
Look , not having been there ...
I just think you &apos;re hurt and you &apos;re saying this to , you know , get back at him .
I mean bad .
Oh ... how come ?
I &apos;ve got news for you-- I never intended to marry him .
I &apos;m not .
I &apos;m not .
I &apos;m just Look -- you know , in a way , it &apos;s good .
He got this out of his system now and he knows it &apos;s not worth it and , you know , someday if you guys got married or something -- Don &apos;t defend that horse &apos;s ass to me .
Shari , I &apos;m just really sorry .
Look , I know this is ... <unk> awkward , but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say ... two words , then ... What do you want ? !
No , no , I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John , &quot; Boy Shari looks beautiful . &quot;
I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it .
You do though , you look great .
<unk> is dangerous .
So maybe this is my dynamite .
I saw this show once .
It was about <unk> .
I was home sick , there was nothing else on .
Do you know how they break up really bad log <unk> ?
You know , when they &apos;re really tangled ... ?
Why do it ?
Hey , believe me <unk> know I &apos;ve got a great chance of making a fool of myself , here .
Are you sure about this ?
Really ?
You see , to me , you shouldn &apos;t have any trouble with men .
There should be , like , a line behind you .
Oh , the whole family loved him .
Of course , they loved the last guy I went out with , and he <unk> me along for three years and dumped me .
I hear the dog really liked him .
A hundred per cent cotton .
Okay , here we go , Andy .
And each <unk> gets one of these .
An &quot; I tried to screw a network executive &quot; <unk> .
I commit .
I take a chance .
You wanted to be the guy on TV , but you didn &apos;t want to say you wanted to .
So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want , but if it goes bad it &apos;s not your fault .
Me ? !
That &apos;s you !
I got paid by the word !
No !
Your problem is you don &apos;t ever want anything to be your fault .
Yeah .
My problem is I &apos;ve got a brother who writes a sentence like &quot; We grew up in a small , little bedroom . &quot;
As opposed to a big , little bedroom ?
You know what your problem is ?
Let &apos;s remember how I got into this .
&quot; Please , Eddie , do this for me .
I can &apos;t get a break . &quot;
Come on , Ma .
I put his -- who -- Look , Marsh , he &apos;s not that good a singer , he &apos;ll be back .
That &apos;s right .
You put Cliff on television .
So then he decided he was too good for her and he left .
Cliff left her , thanks to you .
Ray , come <unk> What are we gonna fight ?
Ray , please , listen to me -- Look , we gotta talk .
Oh , man , I &apos;ve been trying to call you .
If I go over to Shari , the camera &apos;s going there , too .
You brought the girl !
You brought the cameras here !
No , not her .
Shari .
Go over there and talk to her I don &apos;t even know her .
All I know is she likes <unk> .
Stop ?
I &apos;m a guy .
I don &apos;t stop .
The woman &apos;s supposed to stop .
We &apos;re the gas , they &apos;re the brakes .
Next thing you know !
Why didn &apos;t you stop ?
It &apos;s the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she &apos;s very pretty and , you know , she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she &apos;s all &quot; I saw you on TV the other night ... You were so great ... &quot; Next thing I know we &apos;re ... What is this ?
What &apos;s going on , who is that ?
We &apos;d better go ... Hello ... Shari , hi ... Oh no !

Uh , no , uh I &apos;m a little tired .
I fell asleep .

It &apos;s me , Ed .
Who is it ?
While I &apos;m gone , tell them about our cousin Lenny who &apos;s gay .
We knew from when he was five .
What are you , hiding from the Police ?
Show your face , you look great .
Doesn &apos;t she look great .
&quot; Quick pull off the highway &quot; is not a relationship .
Oh man , I gotta pee .
She didn &apos;t know he was a criminal .
They had a relationship .
They -- <unk> !
She spent six months dating a criminal What &apos;s the <unk> -- Remember the last guy she got involved with ?

She &apos;s got a new boyfriend .
No .

Hey , Ed .

I got a good life , this job suits me .
I come and go when I please -- That &apos;s right .
You don &apos;t know .
<unk> don &apos;t fly open for guys like us .
I don &apos;t know .
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life ?
You &apos;re gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life ?
This is your big ambition , <unk> the &quot; <unk> &quot; movies ?
Oh Yeah ?
What &apos;s your master plan here ?
I &apos;m doing all right .
All right .
Let me ask you something ... are you happy like this ?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say &quot; Let me ask you something ? &quot;
Why don &apos;t you just ask me ?
Why do you do that ?
In a second !
In a hot second .
Let me ask you something -- You would do this ?
You would actually -- Oh man !
They couldn &apos;t pick me !
They had to pick you !
Look -- there &apos;s a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way ?
I mean , it &apos;s all day !
Every minute .
<unk> be like a monkey at the zoo .
I just ...
I ...
I &apos;m not gonna do it .
Hi , Shari .
Let &apos;s go in the <unk> .
I got your message .
Way to go !
I &apos;m making a tape .
I &apos;m not <unk> <unk> in Panama !
... <unk> !
That &apos;s like ... those people <unk> <unk> in Panama saying they &apos;re in the <unk> .
Yeah .
I service video equipment .
You &apos;re in show business ?
Yeah , but let &apos;s stay on one subject .
Whoever that person is is going to be famous .
They &apos;ll be able to get whatever they want .
They &apos;ll ... trust me , this is my business .
What are you drunk ?
That !
Being that guy .
Being the guy they watch .
You know , that would be like a great thing .
I know .
I mean I &apos;m sitting there and her father &apos;s asking me about my &quot; career prospects &quot; and I &apos;m playing &quot; <unk> , &quot; with her kid brother , Leon and at dinner the dog &apos;s sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog .
&apos;Cause her mother disappeared for a while .
What do you mean all of a sudden ?
You &apos;ve been going with her six months .
I was ... having dinner with Shari and her parents .
Where were you ?
I love you !
1 want to marry you !
No -- keep it .
No <unk> .
You want a picture ?
Mr. <unk> .
I &apos;m sorry to bother you .
My son would just love to have your autograph .
Oh , is Shari here ?
Why didn &apos;t you just say so ?
Why are you giving me a <unk> about being tired ?
Ray , where do you keep the glasses ?
No .
Ray sat on it .
I &apos; 11 see you .
Do you still have it ?
-- That we were doing &quot; together . &quot;
I finished it .
It came out great !
Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - &quot; That &apos;s too much <unk> .
You &apos;re using too much <unk> . &quot;
The pirate ship .
Yeah ?
That &apos;s good .
Sorry is good .
You know I finished that model .
Ed ...
I &apos;m sorry .
All right ...
This is my father , I don &apos;t know what the hell he can do , but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I &apos; 11 ... help you .
I &apos; 11 ... mention your business or ...
I don &apos;t know , we &apos; 11 figure it out .
I gotta go .
I need help .
How many times if just one little thing that I needed would &apos;ve happened , it would &apos;ve changed everything .
If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or ... the <unk> just never clicked for me .
So you saw me on TV and you said &quot; Hey , let me jump on this . &quot;
The last two years , I &apos;ve been a limousine driver , but I don &apos;t see well anymore , so ... Oh , man !
So ... No .
Two times .
The whole time ?
Eighteen years ?
I was in jail .
It could be , if you fixed it up .
How did you ... ?
I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this ?
Quite a <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
Who is it ?
No .
Am I supposed to ?
You don &apos;t recognize me .
<unk> ... do you own a cat ?
What is ?
Oh , dinner !
No .
It &apos;s going to be about a half-hour .
Can I help with anything ?
Why don &apos;t you come over .
And I &apos; 11 make dinner .
And you bring a movie .
And ... We &apos; 11 make a night of it ... okay ?
Are you busy tomorrow night ?
We have to stop meeting like this .
Oh , great !
Thanks .
I &apos;m just going uptown .
Um ...
They gave me a limo , uh ... Well , it was really nice meeting you and , uh ...
I &apos;d better get a cab .
Oh , yeah , I love those .
Yeah ... those are funny ...
Thanks ... That &apos;s ...
I &apos;m Jill .
I really like your show .
I think you &apos;re great .
That girl &apos;s an idiot .
If they keep Ed on for one full month , he gets a balloon payment .
What does that have to do with ... ?
For instance ... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss .
His equipment , trucks , client list , the whole <unk> .
That &apos;s the point -- this could change things .
Look , my life is not so great , that I want it shown on television .
And neither is yours .
Everyone has foibles .
Then the whole country sees them on TV and <unk> them .
Then we have ... <unk> foibles .
We don &apos;t have foibles .
What happened ?
You described this &quot; <unk> &quot; family who &apos;d be a million laughs on TV ?
Look , can we all just sign the <unk> so we can get on with this ?
By the <unk>
That &apos;s were two lines cross -- <unk> an <unk> Oh , an TV a minute and already an attitude .
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this ?
Some more make-up wouldn &apos;t do you any harm .
On TV you look a little washed out .
By the <unk>
That Ray was a pig .
Ed is doll .
You <unk> on to him honey .
Sign here , please .
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents .
I haven &apos;t heard from him in a long time .
Poor guy .
I warned him .
Sherry Sherry <unk> .
...
I &apos;m not talking about ethics .
I &apos;m talking about morals .
I don &apos;t need a lecture on ethics , Jim , okay ?
I know what -- That was just talk !
<unk> talk !
What are you , nuts ?
We talk about girls all the time , but it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
I would never .
.
.
I mean , I take very seriously our strict moral code .
The line you &apos;ve crossed is ... it &apos;s illegal and it &apos;s immoral .
You &apos;re not just jealous , are you ?
I mean , we both used to talk about her Dave , I &apos;m just saying this as your friend .
What you &apos;re doing is really , really wrong , and you &apos;ve got to stop .
That &apos;s the whole point .
It &apos;s all in my head ; it &apos;s right here .
I just got to get it out there .
Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it .
It &apos;s beautiful .
But you haven &apos;t written your novel .
Yeah , it &apos;s serious .
I mean she <unk> me in ways Sherry never has .
She even wants to read my novel .
Look , Jim ...
Okay .
I know it all seems crazy , and maybe it did start out , you know , for the ... for the sex and the danger .
But now it &apos;s different .
Jim , what I &apos;m trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally , totally in love .
You did it at your house ?
Your own house ?
<unk> .
.
.
<unk> .
.
.
You know you &apos;re a cute little <unk> ... <unk> ... You know you &apos;re a sweet little love maker ... You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place , and that could get a little <unk> sometimes , but basically he was a real good guy .
She &apos;s incredible .
Everything just gets <unk> .
Don &apos;t tell me that .
I don &apos;t want to know that .
A few months before the election , she &apos;d had an affair with my best friend Dave <unk> .
Here , get down .
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me , the me that nobody else knows .
And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness , and that price is loneliness .
Tracy , I &apos;ve been watching you for going on two years now , and I think you are one of the most talented , <unk> , sensitive , attractive , brilliant students -- no , human beings -- I have ever met .
I mean , you &apos;re the real thing .
Special .
What kind of person ?
What do you mean ?
What kind of person am I ?
I know .
I know its not by choice .
I just mean , well , being the kind of person you are , it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to .
No , I &apos;m not .
I &apos;m just really busy .
Well , I notice you don &apos;t seem to have any close friends at Millard .
You seem to be kind of a loner .
You know , Tracy ...
I don &apos;t know how to say this , but ... One night he took us <unk> out to celebrate after a deadline .
Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student , but like two adults .
Well , Sherry &apos;s great .
But she can be a little much sometimes .
Yeah .
No .
I mean , you know .
You guys have fun ?
Fine .
You know .
We just went to <unk> .
How &apos;d it go ?
Yeah , just -- Come on , <unk> .
<unk> .
Fill me up .
Come on , fill me up Yeah , uh , just a minute You gonna do it ?
You gonna do it ?
He likes it .
Jim , don &apos;t .
You &apos;re scaring him .
Around that time <unk> and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry <unk> &apos;s house , giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time .
Everything &apos;s fine .
Just , you know , school .
Thank God for <unk> .
She was my best friend , my source of love and strength .
Oh sure , we &apos;d had our share of <unk> times , but we &apos;d always seen them through .
After nine years of marriage , we were closer than ever .
And the secret ?
Good communication .
All right .
Well , sure nice to meet you .
Having a problem with your eye there ?
You &apos;re going to Catholic school next year .
You &apos;re going to <unk> Heart .
Maybe they &apos;ll straighten you out !
Tammy , now we &apos;ve come to a decision .
He just think it would be best -- Don &apos;t you smartass me !
Don &apos;t you dare smartass me !
You just shut your mouth I Now your mother and I have had a long talk with <unk> <unk> --- we just got off the phone with him at home .
You know , he doesn &apos;t want you back at Millard .
He &apos;s fed up with you .
<unk> up !
And I don &apos;t blame him !
But , Mr. M. - Larry ?
We &apos;ve got twenty-five minutes until the assembly , and we still have to do counts for <unk> , <unk> and Secretary .
Mr. <unk> and I have both <unk> the numbers , and unless you can come up with the <unk> you claim are missing - I didn &apos;t make a mistake .
Every vote was there when you sac down It happens , Larry .
People make mistakes .
But , they were there I counted <unk> votes .
He &apos;s right .
Two people must have <unk> their <unk> .
Usually it &apos;s more .
See , it doesn &apos;t add up .
There are only <unk> <unk> but <unk> people voted .
Two votes are missing .
Check the register .
Mostly Tammy fans I think we &apos;ve got a problem .
Huh .
Okay .
Well , I guess I &apos;d better do my count .
Larry , we &apos;re not <unk> the fucking Pope here .
Just tell me who won .
I thought those were the rules , Mr. McAllister .
If they &apos;ve changed in any way -- You &apos;re kidding , right ?
I &apos;m not supposed to tell .
Not until you &apos;ve counted too .
We &apos;re each supposed to make an independent count .
What d &apos;you got ?
All right .
I &apos;ll be back Okay .
Yeah .
We know I just want to get this over with , so we can have the assembly and go home .
We don &apos;t have much time until <unk> period .
I have other things going on , too , you know .
You have the key , Mr. McAllister .
Fine .
So do your count .
Start with president , and I &apos;ll be right back .
Well , I thought that ... well , the way it always works is that <unk> president does a count , then the <unk> advisor , you know , for the two independent counts .
What ?
Right .
So let &apos;s start counting .
I hope so You &apos;ll be fine .
I &apos;m scared , Mr. M. I kind of don &apos;t feel ready for college .
Take as much room as you want What a surprise .
Would you sign it for me ?
Oh , is this ... ?
God .
First one of these I haven &apos;t been in for a long time .
I just have to get something .
I &apos;ll be right back .
<unk> , <unk> what heaven or hell <unk> him .
I want you to do something for me .
I &apos;ve got an idea .
Well , I ...
I ... that &apos;s very nice of you .
Nooo .
I just thought ... l mean , I am looking for a new car .
But I just thought , well , I &apos;m going away soon , and you &apos;ll be stuck here and , I don &apos;t know , I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been , well , friends .
Real friends .
And then things would be different .
Don &apos;t you think ?
Coming to see me .
Are you trying to .
.
humiliate me ?
Why are you doing this ?
That sounds good .
And this model comes with <unk> and <unk> air bags standard .
Plenty of pep , too .
<unk> pretty good , don &apos;t you think ?
Anywhere you want .
Just so long as we &apos;re not gone more than a half-hour .
So , are you looking for something <unk> or more practical ?
Good for you .
Good for you Well , I got in everywhere I applied , but <unk> is my first choice .
Huh .
Right .
College .
Wow .
Where are you going ?
Where &apos; d you get into ?
My mother &apos;s buying me a new car for college .
Oh .
New cars .
I see .
Well , you came to the right place I &apos;m looking at new cars .
So what brings you here ?
Hello , Mr. M. That said , the whole point of an election is to choose winners , and that you have done .
We &apos;ll begin with president .
Act surprised .
Walk slowly to the <unk> .
Be modest .
Thank them for this incredible honor .
That &apos;s enough , Tracy .
Quit while you &apos;re ahead , okay ?
I &apos;ll handle this .
Could you ask Walt to come in ?
I told you !
I told you !
You &apos;re going to pay for my <unk> !
You &apos;re off the hook .
Tammy here has <unk> .
What do you mean ?
Looks like today &apos;s your lucky day And I think certain older <unk> like you and your &quot; colleague &quot; shouldn &apos;t be <unk> after their students , especially when some of them can &apos;t even get their own wives pregnant .
And they certainly shouldn &apos;t be running around making <unk> <unk> .
Especially when certain young , naive people &apos;s mothers are <unk> secretaries at the city &apos;s biggest law firm and have won many successful <unk> .
And if you want to keep questioning me like this , I won &apos;t continue without my attorney present .
I agree .
But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very , very grateful the whole school didn &apos;t find out about certain <unk> which could have ruined their <unk> , and chances to win certain <unk> .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re referring to , but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn &apos;t acted like such little babies and gotten all <unk> , everything would be okay .
This isn &apos;t the time or the place to get into it , but there is , for just one example , a certain former colleague of mine , who made a very big mistake , a life mistake .
I think the lesson there is that , old and young , we <unk> make mistakes , and we have to learn that our actions , all of them , can carry serious consequences .
You &apos;re very young , Tracy <unk> , in fact -- but maybe one day you &apos;ll understand .
Why are you <unk> me ?
You &apos;re a very intelligent girl , Tracy .
You have many <unk> qualities .
But someday maybe you &apos;ll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead , and yes , stepping on people to get there , well , there &apos;s a lot more to life than that .
And in the end , you &apos;re only cheating yourself .
well , I don &apos;t know .
It could have been anybody .
There are a lot of , you know , subversive elements around Millard .
You know , like Rick <unk> and Kevin <unk> and those <unk> .
Or Doug <unk> - what about him ?
Or what about Tammy <unk> ?
Her whole thing is being anti- this and <unk> .
Okay , Tracy , so who do you think did it ?
<unk> should we &quot; interrogate ? &quot;
I don &apos;t .
I just know they were there when I left .
I &apos;m giving you helpful information is all .
You know , instead of wasting time <unk> me , we should be out there trying to find out who did this .
6 : 30 .
How do you know what time the posters were torn down ?
I was .
So ?
Mr. <unk> let me in .
As you know , with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so .
But I left very early , around 6 : 30 .
Were you or were you not working in the <unk> office over the weekend ?
Mr. M. , I am running on my <unk> .
I would never need to resort to , you know , to vandalism like a , you know ... Plus , my own best <unk> was torn down .
Did I do that too ?
Wait - are you accusing me ?
You &apos;re not serious .
I can &apos;t ... Mr. McAllister , we have worked together on <unk> for three solid years and ...
I mean , I can &apos;t believe it .
I &apos;m ...
I &apos;m shocked !
A travesty .
Huh .
That &apos;s interesting , because I think you did it .
If it &apos;s about the posters , I think it &apos;s so awful .
It &apos;s a travesty .
I guess you know why you &apos;re here Look , why don &apos;t we just forget about Tammy ?
We &apos;ll have the assembly tomorrow , everybody &apos;ll make their <unk> , and I &apos;m sure everything will be fine .
Tim <unk> ?
Tim <unk> !
Who &apos;s he ?
I &apos;ve never heard of him !
Looks like Tim <unk> .
These are a bunch of <unk> .
And look at this one , I can &apos;t even read this one .
As far as I know , <unk> Are you sure all her signatures are real ?
It &apos;s not easy to get all those signatures .
Calm down , Tracy .
Just calm down .
You &apos;re the advisor .
You should stop her .
She &apos;s not qualified .
She &apos;s just a <unk> .
So like I was saying , things were going pretty well in my life .
Fuck me , Mr. McAllister Good luck , Tracy .
Okay .
That &apos;s good .
I just wanted to make sure .
You know , Mr. M. , when I win the <unk> , that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year .
And I for one would like that time to be <unk> and productive .
Wouldn &apos;t you ?
Yeah .
Okay .
well , good luck Tracy Hell , you know , <unk> &apos;s the world &apos;s number one soft drink , but they spend more money than anybody on advertising .
I guess that &apos;s how come they stay number one .
Should be easy .
So far no competition .
I can &apos;t wait to start <unk> .
Thanks for everything .
Okay , fine .
Sure I thought you were supposed to keep them .
NO , that &apos;s fine Aren &apos;t you supposed to keep them ?
Looks good to me .
Could you approve them now ?
I &apos;d like to kick off my campaign right away , you know , in the morning .
You can put those in my box .
I &apos;ll look at them tomorrow .
Here they are .
Hey , that &apos;s super I got all my signatures .
One hundred and <unk> -- way more than I need !
Oh .
There &apos;s one more thing about Tracy I think you should know .
... the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a ... Now at the end of her junior year , Tracy was <unk> to win the <unk> of the student body .
And so far she was running <unk> .
Okay .
But we &apos;re still missing something key here .
What are we missing ?
Thanks , Mr. M. Well , good luck there , Tracy Yes , I do .
You know what they say about the early bird .
Not wasting any time , are you , Tracy ?
Good morning , Mr. McAllister .
Oh yeah , you bet .
Well , that speech she gave -- it was pretty , you know , pretty out there .
But we &apos;ll get to the bottom of it .
Don &apos;t you worry .
Mr. McAllister is going to see to that .
Right , Jim ?
Even tried you at home .
We &apos;ve got a situation here .
<unk> .
I don &apos;t have class until second period .
Jim , where the hell have you been ?
Yeah ... whatever .
All I know is she &apos;s a troublemaker .
She &apos;s on my list .
Walt , we can &apos;t throw her out of the election just because we don &apos;t like her speech .
That &apos;s not what student government &apos;s about .
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election .
Getting everybody all <unk> up like that .
She &apos;s finished , you hear me ?
<unk> up .
Thanks .
Well .
I &apos;m going home now .
Okay , Jim .
I understand .
Walt will be speaking with you about this , but I need you to find someone to take over my classes .
The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer .
Walt needs to see you .
Life would go on , and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience .
I have proof .
I don &apos;t believe you .
I don &apos;t know .
All I know is I did it I Door was open .
And how did you get in the school ?
I don &apos;t know .
Yesterday .
Sunday .
And when did you do it ?
I did it .
Looks at her <unk> doesn &apos;t say a word .
I &apos;m the one .
I did it .
I tore down Paul &apos;s posters .
What is it .
Tammy ?
Well , this is hard for me , but I think it &apos;s important to be honest .
Don &apos;t you ?
So ... what do you have to tell me ?
Okay .
Because I know who did it .
So ..
I &apos;ll just be outside .
<unk> .
Please just wait outside .
Okay .
But is this about the posters ?
Just wait outside .
Tammy .
You wanted to see me , Mr. M. ?
Me ?
I took advantage of you ?
You hugged me !
You kissed me !
You &apos;re the one who -- I was lonely .
You took advantage A mistake ?
That was no mistake .
We made a mistake .
Let &apos;s not make it worse .
It &apos;s the only true thing I know anymore .
Don &apos;t say that .
You know it &apos;s not true .
Sherry ...
I love you .
Yeah .
I &apos;m here .
What do you want , Jim ?
Easy , tiger .
Come by after school .
I &apos;ll leave <unk> with the sitter .
Take me to that motel .
Like you wanted .
We &apos;ll let it run awhile All his life .
He &apos;s tried everything .
No , I ... uh , didn &apos;t know that Did you know Dave &apos;s a bed <unk> ?
Shall we give it a name ?
points at the motel .
Should we get a what ?
So what do you think ?
Should we get a room ?
Oh , come on .
You &apos;ve had a hard year , you &apos;re <unk> up with the kid all the time .
Let go ; live a little .
I can &apos;t afford this stuff right now .
Okay .
Give me the drill .
More this way .
Without Dave around .
Sherry needed a lot of help around the house .
Could you get this ?
I can &apos;t Your novel ?
Are you fucking kidding me ?
After Dave got fired , Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce .
Don &apos;t worry about Tracy .
She &apos;ll be fine .
Just one more thing .
So , Mr. M. , uh , do you think Tracy &apos;s going to be okay ?
I saw her face after the assembly , and I think she &apos;s taking it pretty hard .
Oh , okay .
Yeah , sorry .
Paul ... Paul .... We &apos;ll have plenty of time to get into all this later .
A whole year , in fact .
Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home .
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house .
But a really good haunted house , not like those cheesy bad ones .
You know , more like the radio station ones .
This one would be really scary .
And for Homecoming -- well , you know how last year &apos;s theme was - Why don &apos;t you guys go sit down , okay ?
I &apos;ll catch up in a minute ?
I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff .
Oh , no .
No .
I &apos;m just finishing up here , and I &apos;ve got to get home .
Exactly .
So what do you say ?
Maybe it &apos;s time to give a little something back .
I also like bananas .
Fine .
Let &apos;s say all you ever knew was apples .
<unk> , apples and more apples .
You might think apples were pretty good , even if you occasionally got a rotten one .
Then one day there &apos;s an orange .
And now you can make a decision .
Do you want an apple , or do you want an orange ?
That &apos;s democracy .
No , wait -- apples .
<unk> .
Okay , let &apos;s say takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the <unk> .
Huh ?
Oh .
Uh ... <unk> Paul , what &apos;s your favorite fruit ?
Yeah .
But one person assured of victory kind of <unk> the whole idea of a democracy , doesn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s more like a ... well , like a <unk> , like we studied .
And she &apos;s <unk> Yeah , no , she &apos;s a <unk> , all right .
Who , me ?
Nooo .
I never ...
I don &apos;t know anything about that stuff , Mr. M. Besides , that &apos;s Tracy <unk> &apos;s thing .
She &apos;s always working so hard and -- Let me give you a clue .
You &apos;re a born leader .
You &apos;re one of the most popular students at Millard .
You &apos;re honest and <unk> .
You don &apos;t choke under pressure , as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against <unk> .
The other kids look up to you .
What does that spell ?
What do you mean ?
But you &apos;ve got a big choice right now .
You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life .
Or you can choose to see it for what it really is : an opportunity .
I personally think you have a big future ahead of you , and I don &apos;t mean the <unk> glory of sports .
I know .
I understand disappointment .
I really do .
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it .
And maybe go on to ... Paul , I know you &apos;ve been pretty down since your accident .
Larry , you just take it easy You said I was a liar You &apos;re the liar , you &apos;re the -- I &apos;m telling you .
Dr. <unk> , every vote was accounted for .
Whoa !
Easy , <unk> .
I don &apos;t like where you &apos;re going .
If you say so .
And <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; right ?
Sorry .
My figures work out exactly the same as Jim &apos;s .
<unk> for Paul , <unk> for Tracy .
No way I It doesn &apos;t make sense .
<unk> ... <unk> ... <unk> .
I get the same as you Jim .
Looks like Paul &apos;s our president .
Well , I do .
I don &apos;t care .
But other people can see them too .
These are private -- these are for us .
People can see this .
Are you crazy ?
I &apos;m not a dyke , okay , and we &apos;re not in love .
We were just ...
I was just experimenting .
I &apos;m not like you .
Where &apos; re you going ?
I told you ...
I can &apos;t .
I just -- It doesn &apos;t feel right anymore , you know ?
Oh , no , hey .
Like I said .
Tammy wouldn &apos;t ... she ...
It was Tammy I That &apos;s who it was .
We still have some extra ones , don &apos;t we ?
Maybe we can just -- I don &apos;t know .
You &apos;re her brother you should know .
I mean at you .
She &apos;s doing this to get back at me It &apos;s a conflict of interest .
And Paul was first .
We can &apos;t both run , can we ?
We &apos;re brother and sister .
Can we ?
<unk> ... teeth .
<unk> .
Thanks .
You too .
It was great working with you .
Have a great summer .
And good luck at college .
Oh , yeah , sure .
Hey Nolan , give my book to Tracy when you &apos;re done * Can I sign yours too ?
Paul , will you sign my <unk> ?
You know , I don &apos;t understand why everybody <unk> Tracy all the time .
She was always <unk> nice to me .
Yeah , you too , Tracy .
I &apos;m just glad it &apos;s over .
Paul , I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out , you &apos;ve run a wonderful campaign .
It &apos;s been fun competing with you .
Good luck to you too , Paul .
Hell , good luck !
Way to go , Tracy !
Isn &apos;t this exciting ?
Okay , Mr. <unk> .
You &apos;re on .
Well , I mean , you know , I talked to him and everything , but he just said he thought it was a good idea ... and how there &apos;s all different kinds of fruit and ...
It &apos;s nothing against you , Tracy .
You &apos;re the best .
I just thought -- So Mr. McAllister asked you to run .
Well , see , I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything ... and how I still want to , you know , do something for the school and -- No .
Uh ...
I just ... you know , I just thought -- You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president ?
What do you mean ?
Who put you up to this ?
Huh ?
Oh , hi , Tracy Who put you up to this ?
Okay .
Great .
I feel good .
Sure , Paul .
No hard feelings .
Yeah .
Oh , one more thing .
Tammy .
You know , all this election stuff .
&apos;Cause , you know , everyone is saying it &apos;s so weird that you &apos;re running against me , and , well , it is kind of weird , and you haven &apos;t really told me why you &apos;re doing it and didn &apos;t tell me in advance or anything .
But that &apos;s okay , you know .
l respect your privacy .
I just want you to know that no matter who wins , if it &apos;s you or me , there &apos;s no hard feelings .
We &apos;re still brother and sister .
Okay ?
Cause ... and I hope you feel the same .
Now could you leave me alone ?
Okay , Paul .
Thanks .
Thanks a lot .
I just thought , well , last time you got <unk> you fell so behind and - Oh .
Hi , Tammy .
I was just , you know , I went to all your teachers and got your <unk> .
What do you want ?
You know how they say one day a big <unk> might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody ?
Well , I think that would be a good thing .
What &apos;d I do ?
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me -- Paul , get out !
Yeah .
So guess what happened .
So Mr. McAllister , he -- Oh hi .
Lisa .
Don &apos;t you fucking knock ?
Hey , Tammy , guess what happened today .
You wanna buy your brother ten years ... ?
You don &apos;t have to say anything .
Just look at this list and point .
Here .
You wanna get me a fuckin &apos; snitch jacket ?
We &apos;re looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns .
One of &apos; em owns a purple <unk> <unk> .
How &apos;d you like to make it <unk> ?
I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with <unk> D.A.
You got a brother up in <unk> .
I know because I put him there .
What do you want , Mr. <unk> ?
I saw you fight Kid <unk> .
I like your style .
What &apos;s it to you ?
How &apos;s the left these days ?
No .
Now .
You fucked him .
In the morning .
So tell me about it .
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley ?
Come in out of the rain , Bud .
How &apos;d you get to know so much about him ?
He &apos;s the opposite of you .
He &apos;s more like me .
Cold , <unk> .
I want to know about Exley .
Come in out of the rain .
In the morning we &apos;ll have both our stories for breakfast .
Did you talk to Exley ?
That simple , huh ?
You found Patchett .
You found me .
You &apos;re smart enough .
Be a detective if that &apos;s what you want .
I used to .
What I do now is <unk> .
Sitting duck stuff ... No , I don &apos;t like it .
If I could work Homicide like a real detective ... Do you like being a cop , Bud ?
Yeah .
But not for long .
So you saved her .
When I was ten , my old man threw a bottle at my mother .
I guess I got in the way .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
All they get is Veronica Lake .
You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken ... Where &apos;d this come from ?
I wondered when you might ring the bell again , Officer White .
Forget I asked .
It was a mistake .
If it &apos;s a date I think you &apos;d better tell me your first name because I -- I don &apos;t know .
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment ?
Look .
I want to see you again .
No .
I &apos;m really a brunette , but the rest is me .
And that &apos;s all the news that &apos;s fit to print .
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake ?
He takes a cut of our <unk> and <unk> it for us .
He makes us quit the life at thirty .
He doesn &apos;t let us use narcotics and he doesn &apos;t abuse us .
Can your policeman &apos;s <unk> grasp those <unk> ?
You look better than Veronica Lake .
Now , &lt; u &gt; Pierce Patchett &lt; / u &gt; .
Actually , it was two .
You &apos;re different , Officer White .
You &apos;re the first man in five years who didn &apos;t tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute .
Yeah , just like the half dozen guys you screwed today .
But you did it anyway .
I &apos;m not sure .
Did they deserve it today ?
When they deserve it .
Do you enjoy it ?
There &apos;s blood on your shirt .
Is that an <unk> part of your job ?
You fuck for money .
You say &apos; fuck &apos; a lot .
Maybe I &apos;m just fucking curious .
I remember you from Christmas Eve .
You have a thing for helping women , don &apos;t you , Officer White ?
Miss Bracken , don &apos;t ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I &apos;ll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears .
You want some advice , Miss Bracken ?
He &apos;s waiting for you to mention mention .
Tell me about Patchett .
Pierce meets people .
Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood .
This is how they turned out .
Thanks to Pierce , we still get to act a little .
How &apos;d she meet Patchett ?
Like I said we were friendly , not friends .
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend ?
I don &apos;t know .
I never heard of the Nite Owl till today .
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl ?
That &apos;s right .
Our motives are selfish , so we &apos;re cooperating .
Yeah I know .
Patchett &apos;s running whores and judging by his address , probably something bigger on the side .
He doesn &apos;t want any attention .
Yes .
But do you know ?
You use words like that , you might make me mad .
No I haven &apos;t .
Do you know why Pierce is <unk> you ?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland ?
Of course I am .
What kind of question is that ?
Are you sorry she &apos;s dead ?
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts , but we weren &apos;t really friends .
You know what I mean ?
Yeah , plain scotch .
Can I get you a drink ?
It &apos;s not what you think .
Somebody hit you ?
It &apos;s practically stamped on your forehead .
That obvious , huh ?
Merry Christmas yourself , &lt; u &gt; Officer &lt; / u &gt; .
Sure , boss .
Sure you can .
You have your extracurricular secrets , I have mine .
We &apos;ll hold a <unk> session soon .
For now , I need your <unk> old habits at the Victory <unk> .
We &apos;re going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes .
Can I count on you ?
You lost me , Dudley .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who <unk> it .
Imagine the means to keep the nigger <unk> sedated .
But don &apos;t stop there .
<unk> .
Imagine the police in control .
It &apos;s big , lad .
I &apos;ve long been involved in <unk> hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit <unk> .
That day will soon be here and you &apos;ll share <unk> .
Grand means will be in our hands , Wendell .
You &apos;re <unk> to me these days , Wendell .
You &apos;re not your old , cruel self anymore .
I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp .
You &apos;ve got it , Wendell .
Give me one minute .
How &apos;d you get them to <unk> ?
How what , Wendell ?
Of course ...
But how ?
Will you work for me ?
Homicide ?
A detective ?
I need you for an assignment the Chief &apos;s given me the <unk> on .
A duty few men are fit for , but you were born for .
You &apos;ll be working out of Homicide .
Four of the <unk> <unk> their testimony .
I knew you had juice , but ...
There &apos;s no goddamn bill on me ?
They &apos;re yours .
Take them .
Doing what ?
<unk> your fucking <unk> ?
Wendell , I want you to come to work for me .
&lt; u &gt; What do you want &lt; / u &gt; ?
Don &apos;t underestimate his skills .
As a politician he <unk> even myself .
But the department needs smart men like Exley and ... direct men like yourself Him and me both .
&lt; u &gt; Fucking Exley &lt; / u &gt; .
Your partner &apos;s through .
Department <unk> on the Chief &apos;s orders .
He &apos;s been billed , he &apos;ll be indicted and he &apos;ll swing .
He helped me out once .
That &apos;s all .
It would &apos;ve happened years ago if you hadn &apos;t carried him .
Why the loyalty , Wendell ?
What &apos;s going to happen to Stensland ?
He &apos;ll give himself <unk> over this .
&lt; u &gt; He &apos;s one &lt; / u &gt; &lt; u &gt; year from his pension &lt; / u &gt; .
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background .
Yeah , I hate them .
<unk> , I admire your <unk> to testify and your loyalty to your partner .
I admire you as a policeman , particularly your <unk> to violence as a necessary <unk> to the job .
And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife <unk> .
Do you hate them , Wendell ?
Dudley , what do you want ?
Call me Dudley .
Captain , what do you want ?
He made his play <unk> he got what he wanted .
They &apos;re making him a detective .
Does that paper say we &apos;ve been indicted ?
Does it say Exley &apos;s a hero for squealing me and Stensland off ?
Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables .
This business , Captain ?
<unk> , may I have a word with you ?
It &apos;s confidential , Bud .
Like that magazines Vincennes <unk> for .
&lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; .
I &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
And hey , if it works out , you &apos;ll get a piece of it .
What are you talking about ?
No .
I &apos;ll tell you sometime .
Not now .
Don &apos;t want to <unk> it .
But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming .
What ?
That new mystery girl you &apos;ve been seeing ?
Rain check me , partner .
I got something big going on tonight .
Yeah , sure ...
I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory .
Want to grab a beer ?
Don &apos;t look so down in the mouth , Bud .
You nailed him good .
I got to write my report first .
Hey , partner .
Grab a cup .
Seen him around .
He used to be a cop .
You know him ?
Yeah .
A great big one .
Was it ... a rat ?
I came home that night and there was blood on the floor .
Susan said <unk> -- Stens had cut himself .
They were acting nervous .
And that Stens kept going under the house .
Easy .
Tell me about the <unk> .
Don &apos;t mind the smell .
I think a rat died behind the wall ... My Susie was a good girl !
No !
Please leave !
What &apos;s through here ?
You said a neighbor heard a <unk> .
Was it outside , inside ?
That &apos;s him .
That &apos;s him .
Look at a picture for me .
Maybe .
I don &apos;t know .
Stens ?
Was it Stens ?
We were never properly introduced .
Susan and I were fighting that day .
She called him by a nickname .
<unk> or <unk> or something .
What was that boyfriend &apos;s name ?
Susie , I told you I didn &apos;t approve of that boyfriend .
He was too old for you .
You let him come into this house and be fresh to me .
I went out one day and old Mrs. <unk> next door saw Susan &apos;s boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a <unk> .
Ma &apos;am , I &apos;m sure she was .
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died .
Tell me about the boyfriend she had .
The one you mentioned at the morgue .
Five minutes .
That &apos;s all .
Let my daughter rest in peace .
Mrs. Lefferts , I &apos;m Officer White with the <unk>
I &apos;d like to ask a couple of questions .
I spent years trying not to live down to mine .
You know , all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father .
A lot of bad stuff happened here .
It &apos;s as good a place as any for it to end .
You figured this was a set-up ?
And you showed up anyway ?
Me ?
You called it .
I got a message that ... You wanted to meet here ?
We should check the records , and , we should talk to Lynn .
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers .
What if <unk> and <unk> took them from the evidence room ?
Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two .
If I let you go , there &apos;ll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow .
They just won &apos;t come on the bus , that &apos;s all .
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this .
What about him ?
Patchett &apos;s dead .
He sent you after me .
I &apos;d say Dudley &apos;s tying up his loose ends .
At least not anymore .
We had one thing figured wrong .
I don &apos;t think Dudley <unk> for Patchett .
He had help getting up there .
Two of his fingers are broken .
It &apos;s a suicide note .
Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running .
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle .
You expecting problems ?
Which one are you and which one am I ?
Let &apos;s go see Pierce Patchett .
Run a <unk> .
With a <unk> ball .
You want to help me swing it ?
There are no rules !
Why the fuck are you doing this ?
The Nite Owl made you .
You want to tear all that down .
Stay smart , Bud .
We build a case .
We play by the rules .
For Jack , for Stensland , for anybody else who got in the way .
I &apos;ve been trying to be smart .
A detective .
But killing those two fuckers , that would be justice .
Let &apos;s just kill them .
Pierce Patchett figures in , too .
That &apos;s the angle Jack was working .
Dudley must work for Patchett .
It &apos;s Dudley for the Nite Owl .
It all keeps coming back to Dudley .
They didn &apos;t find the shotguns .
They planted them .
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were <unk> and <unk> .
It wasn &apos;t the Negroes .
The <unk> Park report was a phony .
And , who says the purple <unk> was spotted outside the Nite Owl ?
Somebody got wind of it , killed them all .
The Nite Owl !
Stensland was going there to sell the heroin .
Then something goes wrong .
Meeks gets killed .
Maybe Stens got greedy , killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend &apos;s house .
The night he died , Stens was all mysterious .
Said he had something big going down .
&lt; u &gt; Stensland and Buzz Meeks &lt; / u &gt; .
<unk> <unk> knocking off Mickey Cohen <unk> .
When they killed Deuce Perkins , they got heroin as a bonus .
Johnny <unk> told me when Meeks disappeared , he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot .
Stensland and Meeks .
What were they up to ?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other .
Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve .
The night I met Lynn .
Lefferts &apos; mother <unk> Stensland as Lefferts &apos; boyfriend , but Stens pretended he didn &apos;t know either one of them .
She told you ?
You don &apos;t know what the word means , you dumb bastard .
It &apos;ll look like justice .
That &apos;s what that fat fuck got .
&lt; u &gt; Justice &lt; / u &gt; .
How &apos;s it going to look on your report ?
Get the fuck away from me .
A naked guy with a gun ?
You expect anyone to believe that ?
Officer White , put down that weapon and -- One in six .
Where &apos;s the girl ?
Someone held up a coffee shop , panicked and killed six people .
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence .
Yeah , that &apos;s Stens .
It &apos;s a surprise .
You like surprises , don &apos;t you , White ?
Where are we going ?
Of course ... this is personal with you , isn &apos;t it , Mr. White ?
I got her address .
No , Mr. White .
Pierce <unk> Patchett .
Now , I sense you &apos;re on your best behavior , but that &apos;s all I &apos;ll give you .
If you <unk> , I &apos;ll meet you with my attorney .
Now , would you like Miss Bracken &apos;s address ?
I doubt she knows anything , but -- That &apos;s why her mother couldn &apos;t I.D.
her ... Jesus fucking Christ .
There &apos;s Gardner , Hepburn , <unk> , Turner .
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake .
I use girls who look like movie stars .
Sometimes I <unk> a plastic surgeon .
What little studio ?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio .
Wait .
Our deal still holds ?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially ?
I think she &apos;d been hit in the face with a tennis racket .
She is -- was -- a big doubles fan .
Why were Lefferts &apos; eyes black ?
Then listen closely , because I &apos;ll only say this once and if it gets repeated , I &apos;ll deny it .
I run call girls .
Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts .
I treat my girls very well .
I have grown daughters , myself , and I don &apos;t like the thought of women being hurt .
I sense you share this feeling .
Then you wouldn &apos;t feel <unk> to report them ?
Do you care about criminal matters <unk> to Susan &apos;s murder ?
I don &apos;t have one .
Lefferts looked <unk> Christmas Eve , but didn &apos;t act it .
How come ?
Against your code ?
Thanks , but no thanks .
He no longer works for me .
Find Susan &apos;s killer , Mr. White .
I &apos;ll give you a handsome reward .
&lt; u &gt; Whatever you desire &lt; / u &gt; .
Where &apos;s the other guy ?
Buzz .
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl .
I &apos;m investigating .
We met outside Hollywood <unk> on Christmas Eve .
This is where Lynn Bracken &apos;s booze bills go .
You know I do or you wouldn &apos;t be here .
How did you find me ?
Officer White .
How about Susan Lefferts ?
You know her ?
I don &apos;t know him .
Mr ...
I was here , hosting a party .
Who was killed and why do you think I can help ?
I &apos;m a homicide detective .
Where were you last night ?
I am .
Are you <unk> for police charities ?
The last time , you people called at my office .
Are you Pierce Patchett ?
I &apos;m not asking you .
I don &apos;t know .
I swear it !
He &apos;s under a tract house in San <unk> .
And he don &apos;t smell too good .
What happened to the heroin , Johnny ?
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now .
Deuce Perkins .
Mickey C &apos;s narcotics lieutenant .
The night he got <unk> , eighteen pounds of Mickey &apos;s heroin went missing .
Bullshit .
Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin ?
Before Meeks disappeared he was <unk> off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin .
How &apos; bout I give you your balls back ?
More &apos;s gonna cost you .
Oh , yeah .
That was a long time ago .
Before your day .
The last few years he &apos;s been muscle for hire .
But I heard he &apos;s disappeared .
His file listed you as a known associate .
Now spill .
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks ?
He works for a guy named Patchett .
What do you want , &lt; u &gt; officer &lt; / u &gt; ?
I ain &apos;t your &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; , you <unk> cocksucker .
Wendell White , how &apos;s tricks , &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; ?
And you fuck people up for a living .
That don &apos;t make me you .
&lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; , <unk> ?
Officer White .
I heard you got a hard-on for wife <unk> .
It &apos;s like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in ... What do you mean ?
It doesn &apos;t exactly play like dumb panic .
Exactly .
At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears .
<unk> balls .
I found them just inside the meat locker door .
Dick Stensland .
Had to be dumb panic .
If she knew him she would &apos;ve been sitting with him ...
Right ?
But she &apos;s moving away from the door .
Who was sitting at this table ?
It looks like she was <unk> , trying to get away .
If she was sitting here , then it &apos;s <unk> the wrong way .
What are these <unk> in the blood ?
You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were <unk> ?
I can &apos;t think of anything .
Anything off .
Anything that didn &apos;t make sense .
What do you want to know ?
I &apos;m tying up loose ends .
<unk> my report .
You know how it goes .
I don &apos;t know if you read the papers , but that case is closed .
I got a few Nite Owl questions .
Bud White , what brings you down to the basement ?
All right , Ed .
Call Sergeant Vincennes .
Jack Vincennes .
He &apos;s the technical advisor on &apos; <unk> of Honor , &apos; sir .
He lives for it .
That &apos;s the way to get him .
I know that , sir .
I also know that when he made lieutenant , it was as a detective .
Ed , you &apos;re 30 .
Your father didn &apos;t make lieutenant until he was <unk> .
And I &apos;ll promote you .
You &apos;ll be a lieutenant immediately .
I &apos;ll testify , sir .
I &apos;m not afraid to do what &apos;s right .
I want to know who we give the public in <unk> ?
The department needs role models .
<unk> , &lt; u &gt; forthright &lt; / u &gt; men the public can admire .
The public demands justice , sir .
This was a <unk> riot of policemen .
Shift the guilt to men whose <unk> are <unk> .
Force them to retire .
But someone has to swing .
<unk> , try and convict Stensland and Bud White .
<unk> them jail time .
Feed them to the sharks , sir .
<unk> yourself ; protect the department .
Ed , your <unk> have been <unk> .
What &apos;s your <unk> of this situation ?
Just show me where they are !
I don &apos;t have time .
I have -- Where are the police academy files ?
Someone must &apos;ve pulled the records .
So on active duty , Meeks didn &apos;t make an arrest from 1938 to &apos; <unk> .
Until he <unk> down six people .
More or less .
I got the rap sheets on the black guys , sir .
Coates and Jones got charges a mile long .
But except for some kid stuff , <unk> &apos;s clean .
Where do they get their stuff ?
Come on .
Give me one to feed the D.A.
Just a little one .
<unk> and Larry fuck with that shit , not me .
Were you on <unk> ?
You were passed out when you got arrested .
Were you <unk> up , Ray ?
I got nothin &apos; more to say till I see a judge .
You guys were arrested this morning , but none of you have last night &apos;s clothes .
&lt; u &gt; You &lt; / u &gt; were seen burning them .
Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn &apos;t look good .
Why were you throwing clothes in the building <unk> ?
I don &apos;t own no shotguns .
Ray , we got the shotguns .
Man , what &apos;re you saying ?
Oh ?
you feel that way about people , too ?
<unk> got no reason to live .
I heard you like to shoot dogs .
You ain &apos;t <unk> &apos; I did .
Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin &apos; dog .
Ray , you protected <unk> and Larry up in <unk> , didn &apos;t you ?
Man , why &apos;re you talkin &apos; about Larry ?
His business is his business .
Nothing , Ray .
That Larry , he &apos;s a <unk> .
You did the <unk> Youth Camp with him , didn &apos;t you ?
That fucking Larry .
I almost believed him .
I never truck with no <unk> !
Just getting my facts straight .
<unk> makes it a gas chamber <unk> .
You should have pulled this <unk> a couple of years ago .
Get life , do a little Youth <unk> <unk> , transfer to <unk> a big man .
<unk> on some of that good prison <unk> , get yourself a <unk> -- Man , why do you keep asking me that ?
You look like Robinson after that last <unk> fight .
&apos;Course <unk> looked a lot worse .
So you &apos;re twenty-two , right ?
Did one of the officers work you over a little ?
Say what and so what .
You &apos;re twenty-two , aren &apos;t you , Ray ?
Some <unk> is moving in and we don &apos;t know who ? !
Maybe we should ask <unk> <unk> !
Gone .
Not a trace .
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me ?
Nobody .
At least not yet .
I don &apos;t want a floor plan ; I want to know who !
Who &apos;s taking the ticket for this , Johnny ?
They shot him in his library .
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got <unk> last night ? !
In my car .
<unk> shit .
The trunk under the carpet .
Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn , looks just like <unk> -- He runs call girls .
<unk> tail .
<unk> up like movie stars .
<unk> , Mr. <unk> , is the key to all relationships .
Okay .
Okay .
Everyone knows Patchett &apos;s worth a <unk> of <unk> .
From <unk> , freeway construction .
But the man has <unk> , too .
He <unk> B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers .
And try this on : he &apos;s <unk> to be a <unk> heroin <unk> .
All in all a powerful <unk> scenes <unk> .
Alright .
We &apos;ll drop that line for now .
Next topic .
Please comment on Pierce Patchett .
Okay so we worked together .
It was an information exchange .
I got him first class collars and he got me good stories .
We were friends for Chrissakes !
What does that have to do -- But you were business associates ?
Take it easy !
I didn &apos;t have anything to do with him getting killed if that &apos;s what you mean .
<unk> Jack .
The Big <unk> I can tell you he &apos;s on the Night <unk> to the big <unk> .
It &apos;s for your own safety .
Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes ?
I &apos;m happy to cooperate .
You don &apos;t need to tie me down .
This is Mr. <unk> , Wendell .
&lt; u &gt; Really &lt; / u &gt; ?
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a <unk> attorney &apos;s working <unk> ?
Something like that .
Why not , lad ?
<unk> justice ?
Absolutely .
<unk> and gambling are <unk> crimes .
The heroin we &apos;ll run down to the <unk> .
<unk> them .
As long as it &apos;s not a middle class problem , no one will care .
It &apos;s still a crime free city ... for respectable people .
And now you &apos;ll provide them .
A vacuum , Edmund .
That &apos;s what we have in Los Angeles .
<unk> Mickey Cohen up created it .
My <unk> work maintained it .
Certain photographs guarantee it .
<unk> crime has been held back , but there &apos;s still a demand for the services it <unk> .
Jack was a shame , but Dick Stensland had the <unk> to try to sell me my own heroin .
Through his whore girl friend .
I sent him to make the buy .
The rest is history .
Tell that to Jack Vincennes .
To Stensland .
I &apos;m loathe to kill my brother officers , Edmund .
Anonymous .
Probably nothing .
No ... Where &apos;d the tip come from ?
Something &apos;s wrong .
I feel it inside .
Doesn &apos;t that sound crazy ?
There always are .
But there are also three men and three guns .
<unk> <unk> .
A few loose ends don &apos;t matter .
There are loose ends out there , Dudley .
I -- She may still be alive , whoever she is .
Don &apos;t get sidetracked .
Stay with the Nite Owl .
I &apos;ll break them , sir .
Ed , I want <unk> .
Get on it .
We got a call earlier on three <unk> <unk> .
<unk> shotguns in <unk> Park from a <unk> purple <unk> <unk> .
It &apos;s mine .
I &apos;ll make you my second in command .
Yes , I do , sir .
Edmund , you don &apos;t want it and you can &apos;t have it .
Sir , I took the call .
It &apos;s my case .
His blood &apos;s always up .
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up .
So be it .
Yes , Dudley .
I am .
You &apos;ll <unk> the benefits , but are you truly prepared to be <unk> within the department ?
No , Edmund .
He &apos;s a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time .
White &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
Stensland &apos;s a disgrace .
Straight D <unk> reports from every C.O.
he ever served under .
But White is a valuable officer .
At least get rid of the glasses .
I can &apos;t think of one Bureau man who wears them .
I know you mean well , Dudley , but I don &apos;t need to do it the way you did .
Or my father .
Then for God &apos;s sake , don &apos;t be a detective .
Stick to <unk> where you won &apos;t have to make those choices .
Patrol , Internal Affairs , but not the Bureau .
Would you be willing to shoot <unk> criminals in the back to <unk> the chance -- Would you be willing to beat <unk> out of suspects you knew to be guilty ?
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a <unk> attorney &apos;s working <unk> ... ?
Yes or no , Edmund .
Answer yes or no .
Dudley , we &apos;ve been over this .
Am I ... ?
Would you be willing to plant <unk> evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to <unk> an <unk> ?
I was thinking Detective Bureau .
You &apos;ll make lieutenant inside a year .
Patrol division ?
The youngest <unk> by eight years .
That was his favorite toast .
I saw the test results on the lieutenant &apos;s exam .
You placed first out of twenty-three .
Not even with Exley ?
Have you discussed this with anyone else , John ?
Don &apos;t start trying to do the right thing , John .
You haven &apos;t had enough practice .
It &apos;s a private investigation .
I fucked something up and I want to make <unk> .
You &apos;re <unk> , lad , not Homicide .
And since when do you work with Edmund ?
Part of it has to do with a murder .
I &apos;ve been working with Ed Exley on it .
What &apos;s this all about , lad ?
Twelve years ago he worked a vice <unk> with Dick Stensland .
They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam .
Guy ran hookers .
He &apos;d have them photographed with their <unk> , then <unk> for some blackmail .
<unk> got dropped .
<unk> evidence .
You were <unk> officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it .
A disgrace as a policeman .
Straight D <unk> reports from every C.O.
he ever served under .
What about him ?
You remember Buzz Meeks , Dudley ?
Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara .
Two minutes , Dudley .
It &apos;s important .
John Vincennes .
It &apos;s three <unk> , lad .
I think you &apos;ll be surprised what Edmund &apos;s capable of .
You think golden boy can handle it , <unk> ?
Okay .
I &apos;ll do it .
John , I doubt you &apos;ve ever drawn a stupid breath .
Don &apos;t start now .
Great .
You get the girl , I get the coroner .
I &apos;m going to Lynn Bracken &apos;s .
I &apos;ll meet you at the <unk> Car .
What are you going to do ?
She &lt; u &gt; is &lt; / u &gt; <unk> Turner .
She is <unk> Turner .
Yeah .
But first I want to brace <unk> .
High line whores .
With plastic surgery to look like movie stars .
And who knows what else ?
It &apos;s run by this guy Pierce Patchett .
You want to talk to him ?
<unk> star hookers .
Whatever you desire ...
It &apos;s <unk> again .
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White .
What the hell &apos;s going on ?
Jesus ... Maybe White &apos;s not so dumb after all .
Bud White .
He sees us and we &apos;re dead .
What &apos;s that for ?
A third .
I don &apos;t think we can make a case without Bud White .
Okay , college boy , I &apos;ll help you .
But I want half the collar .
I want to do it right .
The Nite Owl was <unk> , Lieutenant .
I &apos;ve given up angles for awhile .
I just want to solve this thing .
I &apos;m trying to figure what angle you &apos;re playing &lt; u &gt; this &lt; / u &gt; time , but I sure as hell can &apos;t see one .
<unk> &apos;s the reason I became a cop .
I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it .
It was supposed to be about truth and justice and <unk> .
But somewhere along the way I forgot all that ... How about you , Jack ?
Why &apos;d you become a cop ?
So what &apos;s the point ?
<unk> was a purse <unk> .
My father ran into him off duty .
He shot my father six times and got away clean .
No one even knew who he was .
I made the name up to give him some personality .
Is there more to that , or do I have to guess ?
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl , &lt; u &gt; Lieutenant &lt; / u &gt; .
It &apos;s a simple question .
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings ?
I ain &apos;t a priest , Lieutenant .
I can &apos;t hear your confession .
Listen , I think I made a mistake , too .
Yeah .
My whole life .
You make a mistake ?
Transfer me , <unk> me .
Just leave me alone .
Yesterday yes , today no .
What happened last night ?
Yesterday that might &apos;ve meant something .
Pull me off .
You &apos;d be doing me a big favor .
It &apos;s not a request .
I need to know what White knows .
Follow him or I &apos;ll have you pulled off &apos; <unk> of Honor . &apos;
<unk> .
Even I &apos;m not that crazy .
I want you to follow Bud White .
Give me a minute , will ya ?
I need to speak to you .
Just don &apos;t shoot me .
&lt; u &gt; Shit &lt; / u &gt; .
Someone beat us here .
I &apos;m <unk> three old <unk> who &apos;ll be fishing in Oregon next week .
Next to you I &apos;m clean .
And smart .
What about you ?
You &apos;re playing an angle , college boy .
You &apos;re getting something out of this so you don &apos;t have to <unk> with the fucking rank and file cops who &apos;ll hate your guts for <unk> .
If they &apos;re making you a detective , watch out .
Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you &apos;re gonna have to work with friends of theirs .
You &apos;re the payoff expert .
I &apos;m just doing my duty .
Yeah , Exley .
What &apos;s the payoff ?
I should &apos;ve known .
What &apos;s the Chief throwing you ?
You &apos;re the key witness ?
Of his penis , sir ?
I get the idea .
You got a description ?
With <unk> and plastic <unk> and ... on his penis , sir .
A guy dressed as Santa has been <unk> himself to kids in Los <unk> .
Apparently , sir , he &apos;s decorated himself .
What &apos;s on the call sheet ?
I got Vincennes in the next room .
It &apos;s not a good week for cops in general .
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl .
Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita &apos;s mother .
It &apos;s not a good week for <unk> .
Bud White <unk> me on it this morning .
You know , he &apos;s not as dumb as I thought .
What are you talking about ?
Yeah .
The fact that you guys won &apos;t let it get filed away .
The Nite Owl .
Anything bothering you about the case ?
Hold on ... We need to <unk> .
See if a purple <unk> was seen around here tonight .
We got a total of forty-five spent <unk> Remington shotgun shells .
Three men with <unk> pumps .
All of them <unk> twice .
Then try talking to my lawyer .
Good evening , gentlemen .
Not good enough .
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her ?
Why do men and women usually see each other ?
Why &apos;s she seeing Bud White ?
What &apos;s her name ?
A vulgar term , but yes .
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores ?
For the last time .
I may <unk> women into <unk> activities , but they &apos;re <unk> <unk> , I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect .
Bud White &apos;s been here ?
I &apos;ll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan &apos;s death .
Some men get the world .
Others get <unk> and a trip to Arizona .
Do you think I ever could &apos;ve been in the running ?
Where is he ?
Right now , before I back down .
<unk> , Arizona .
The air &apos;s good for <unk> and I know where everything is .
Where will you go ?
I know how he feels .
Okay .
Look , if it helps , Bud hates himself for what he did .
I work for Patchett .
I had a feeling that there was someone else , but I never knew who .
A police captain .
I think he &apos;s behind all of this .
Forget everything else for a second , Lynn .
Is there anything you can give me on Dudley <unk> ?
If I knew you were coming I &apos;d have baked a cake .
Actually , Bud &apos;s only tough on the outside .
You , me and White , huh ?
Like <unk> like .
I &apos;m pretty tough , myself .
You &apos;re the first person to ever call me tough .
You &apos;re tougher than Bud thinks you are .
Because you &apos;ll use it against me .
Won &apos;t you ?
No .
This is the means to the reality .
But I &apos;m not going to tell you what it is .
I came out here with a dream .
That &apos;s gone , but I settled for reality .
You cut to the heart of things , don &apos;t you ?
What about Lynn Bracken ?
She going to be a hooker all her life ?
You don &apos;t like that you don &apos;t know how to play him .
He doesn &apos;t follow the same rules of politics you do .
That makes him dangerous .
I don &apos;t hate White .
I really don &apos;t .
It &apos;s just , in my business , it &apos;s the wild cars you have to watch out for .
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier ?
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money .
I see him because he doesn &apos;t know how to <unk> who he is .
There &apos;s more if you want to hear it .
I &apos;ll take your word for it .
I see Bud because I want to .
I see Bud because he can &apos;t hide the warmth he has inside him .
I want to know why you see him .
Is it a Patchett payoff ?
You want to know what Bud &apos;s like in bed ?
How about White ?
The silver screen &apos;s loss is your gain .
You sound like you mean it .
Oh , the best I ever had .
Absolutely the best .
How was I ?
The way you &apos;ve underestimated Bud White ?
Don &apos;t underestimate me , Miss Bracken .
It <unk> you that I know so much about you .
You don &apos;t have information to compete .
I &apos;m curious about you .
He can take care of himself and I &apos;m not afraid of you .
And you forgot one thing , Lieutenant .
Pierce also taught me how to fuck ... Can I get you a drink ?
Let &apos;s concentrate on my <unk> .
Pierce Patchett made you , didn &apos;t he ?
He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results .
But I need some answers and if I don &apos;t get them , I &apos;m going to take you and Patchett down .
He said you were smart .
He also said you were competing with your dead father .
How did he put it ?
Trying to measure up to a ghost .
Really ?
What did White say ?
I know who you are .
You &apos;re the policeman Bud told me about .
Miss Bracken , I &apos;m Lieutenant Exley .
What &apos;s Dudley &apos;s scheme ?
Okay !
You &apos;re right !
Dudley &apos;s got photos of me and Reynolds .
I &apos;m not going to <unk> <unk> answers .
If you &apos;ll excuse me , I &apos;ve got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for .
The proof had his throat slit .
So far you &apos;re not denying it .
Do you have any proof ?
Without what , his <unk> yours first ?
What &apos;s he got on you , Loew ?
Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down ?
Absolutely not .
Dudley <unk> is a highly decorated member of this city &apos;s police department and I won &apos;t smear his name without -- None .
Call it a hunch .
On what evidence ?
I want D.A.
bureau men to tail Dudley <unk> twenty-four hours a day ; I want you to get a judge to <unk> a wire tap on his home phone ; I want <unk> to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour .
It &apos;s okay .
These are police .
&lt; u &gt; What &lt; / u &gt; do you want ?
I don &apos;t doubt it -- Oh , God .
My daughter was a virgin !
All he found were <unk> .
No signs of foul play .
So there .
Under the house .
A sweet man .
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing <unk> .
Mrs. Lefferts , I just want to ask a few questions .
Let my Susie rest in peace !
At Christmas .
We had fought .
I didn &apos;t like her boyfriend .
I -- she has a <unk> on her hip .
When was the last time you saw her , Mrs. Lefferts ?
It seems like my Susan , but ...
I put Reynolds in the cab myself .
The night cost me a hundred <unk> and I got <unk> .
Loew didn &apos;t go with him .
You &apos;re sure ?
Jesus .
Jack , that &apos;s a story .
<unk> <unk> Gets The <unk> Blade . &apos;
Let me get my camera .
He &apos;s dead .
I was just there .
Somebody slit his throat .
You didn &apos;t get my message ?
It got called off .
The kid <unk> out at the last minute .
What happened with the kid and Loew ?
What &apos;s wrong , <unk> ?
Give me some <unk> skinny .
I want to put out an all <unk> issue .
<unk> jazz <unk> and movie stars .
Maybe tie it into the <unk> .
You like ?
Sid , cut the crap .
I -- Jackie !
You got some good scoop for the <unk> ?
Jackie , all I know is what you know .
The man is very rich .
And he &apos;s <unk> in freeway construction so he &apos;s gonna get a lot <unk> .
But that &apos;s it .
Patchett &apos;s what I like to call &apos; <unk> . &apos;
He ain &apos;t queer , he ain &apos;t Red , he can &apos;t help me in my quest for prime <unk> .
Where &apos;d you hear that ?
Sid , why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers ?
He &apos;s queer too .
Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with <unk> .
On screen and off .
I &apos;m getting him to fuck the D.A.
for a hundred bucks .
That &apos;s twice the fifty you got for <unk> his career .
How &apos;d you like a little <unk> ?
Not to mention a donation to the <unk> and <unk> fund .
Did you know Loew was a <unk> ?
Sure , he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke .
You tight with the D.A. , trash ?
What &apos;s he doing here , Sid ?
The <unk> &apos;s Chinese pot bust .
He just got off the honor farm .
Down around my <unk> .
Sid , how are they hanging ?
You &apos;re back , <unk> .
No .
No , I &apos;ve heard <unk> .
Jack , I &apos;ll talk to you later .
Call me when you get something I can use .
<unk> &apos;s from hunger .
For sad <unk> who can &apos;t get their ashes hauled What about <unk> ?
Their <unk> &apos;s &apos; Whatever you desire . &apos;
Not a word .
Don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m chasing picture books .
Fuck shots , but the <unk> don &apos;t look like <unk> .
It &apos;s well done stuff .
I thought you might have heard something .
No .
But I &apos;ve got something going with <unk> Vice .
Jackie , are you back on <unk> ?
I need copy .
Sid , it &apos;s Vincennes .
&lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; .
Off the record and on the <unk>
Yeah , it &apos;s subtle .
It &apos;s Christmas morning in the City of Angels , and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous , <unk> <unk> for marijuana , not knowing that a man is coming to stop them .
The <unk> <unk> , <unk> Big V , celebrity <unk> , Jack Vincennes , the <unk> of grasshoppers and junk <unk> everywhere .
You like it , <unk> Boy ?
I like it !
I like it !
Stand there with your camera .
I &apos;ll stop here so you get <unk> &apos;s Chinese in the <unk> .
They &apos;re sitting in the dark , <unk> on the Christmas tree .
No .
It &apos;s felony possession of marijuana .
Jack !
It &apos;s Christmas !
I need an extra fifty .
Two <unk> at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station .
<unk> players at Metro .
You pinch &apos; em .
I do you up <unk> in the next issue .
Plus the usual fifty cash .
Tell me , am I fucking Santa Claus ?
You lost me , Sid .
Who ?
Beats me .
Look , <unk> , a friend of mine just sold some <unk> to <unk> Reynolds .
He &apos;s <unk> the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at <unk> <unk> , Hollywood Hills .
It &apos;s right around the corner .
We did a piece last year .

Her name got mentioned .

May I have this dance ?
Please hold , Sergeant ... Yeah .
Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting .
I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett .

This is <unk>
Vincennes .
<unk> a name and address on a phone number .
Hollywood <unk> <unk> .
Pacific Coast <unk> .
It &apos;ll be our secret .
And no one &apos;ll know about this ?
I &apos;m pretty sure I can get you a part on the show ...
But tonight ?
Pretend it &apos;s an acting job , kid .
<unk> .
Yeah .
Me neither .
You know , when I came out to L.A. , this isn &apos;t exactly where I saw myself ending up .
Pierce isn &apos;t like regular people .
I dig him , but he scares me too .
Yeah .
Me and Patchett go way back .
<unk> , liquor , hookers that look like movie stars .
Pierce Patchett has it all .
<unk> .
<unk> you desire . &apos;
Oh , I know .
A <unk> party , right ?
Something like that .
Was it a party ?
Have we met before ?
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one .
Working whores with squad two .
Oh ?
<unk> else ?
Yeah , <unk> .
Back in <unk> .
Vincennes , is there someplace you &apos;d rather be ?
Gee .
The Great <unk> Book <unk> of <unk> . Who are you calling ? !
<unk> to anyone !
I need some help here !
Maybe you <unk> into someone who took it and you didn &apos;t even know .
Don &apos;t know .
Did you check everywhere ?
Maybe it was hidden in something .
Maybe there was someone <unk> Nothing .
Two nights later I was robbed .
I &apos;m pretty sure they were pros .
He didn &apos;t give you an address ?
He didn &apos;t give you a phone number ?
I just gave him my card .
I &apos;m telling you , I-- Don &apos;t bullshit me , I can save your life .
What &apos;d he give to you ?
What &apos;d he say to you ?
And you were the last one to talk to him .
&lt; u &gt; They &lt; / u &gt; said he was behind an extortion scheme .
You said he was behind an extortion scheme .
I don &apos;t know anything about Zavitz .
They found him yesterday folded <unk> in a car trunk .
What about Zavitz ?
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto .
After we talked , he agreed to resign .
Next , a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz .
Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind .
The FBI started looking into mob connections .
A <unk> picture in the paper .
<unk> , I &apos;m ruined .
Wife .
job , bank accounts , everything gone .
Brill &apos;s dead .
He died of small <unk> when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field .
My name doesn &apos;t matter .
I don &apos;t want any money .
And believe me , I have no interest in ruining your life .
I &apos;m not interested in this tape .
So ... how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life ?
Me neither , but the <unk> is I &apos;ve got color <unk> footage of you and <unk> <unk> and it doesn &apos;t look good .
I don &apos;t know what that means .
It &apos;s actually <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a frequency <unk> .
Be careful , Danny .
I &apos;ll come straight there .
Come straight here .
Don &apos;t talk to anyone .
I &apos;m doing a transfer now .
When can you get it here ?
No one .
But I &apos;m a little nervous .
Who else have you told ?
Clear as day .
You &apos;ve got it on tape ?
Alright , I made a joke about squirrels , don &apos;t get so-- Goddammit , shut the fuck up and turn on <unk> !
They keep taking the bird seed .
I thought since you &apos;re the expert on-- Turn on <unk> .
Lemme ask you something .
I put a bird <unk> out in the yard , but the squirrels , they keep <unk> <unk> of chasing squirrels around the park ?
Listen to me-- Zavitz , what ?
You want your old job back ?
Well considering what a <unk> <unk> bag you are , David , maybe I &apos;d do best to simply kick your ass all over the <unk> .
<unk> the enormous exposure to which you &apos;ve <unk> this firm , I &apos;d think you &apos;d do best to simply answer my questions .
Told by whom ?
I &apos;m told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago .
I don &apos;t know who he is .
Why don &apos;t you just call Brill directly .
I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks .
She &apos;s the <unk> between for a private investigator I use .
A direct one .
What kind of a question is that ?
Tell us about Rachel Banks .
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam <unk> and having any relationship whatsoever with the <unk> family .
They want to hold you in <unk> for ethics <unk> .
We &apos;ve also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs .
Not particularly , no .
He came in four minutes ago .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> .
There &apos;s Albert &apos;s D.C. office address and his phone &apos;s identity code .
Now we just <unk> out phone with his ID code and you know what we &apos;ve got ?
What are you dialing ?
I know my phone number and I know the number for <unk> .
Beyond that-- What do you know about <unk> cellular phone signals ?
We &apos;ll have to <unk> some basics .
How fast can you learn ?
We &apos;re gonna lead Albert by the nose to one <unk> .
And then when he &apos;s pissed as hell , we &apos;re gonna drop the tape in his lap .
How fast can you teach me what I need to know ?
No , I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert .
You wanna get caught spying on Albert ?
Same way they did with you and me .
We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us .
What if we just fucked with &apos; em ?
What if &lt; u &gt; what &lt; / u &gt; ?
They &apos;ve done it before .
Takes maybe two minutes .
If they couldn &apos;t do that , they &apos;d shut down the whole system , all the <unk> .
Nah , they &apos;d shut down the pin number .
What if we <unk> it over cellular ?
&lt; u &gt; I &lt; / u &gt; know .
&lt; u &gt; I &lt; / u &gt; know what they &apos;re looking for and I &apos;m telling you .
Well how do &lt; u &gt; I &lt; / u &gt; know what they &apos;re-- The area &apos;s wired for surveillance , they &apos;ll be &lt; u &gt; looking &lt; / u &gt; for those moves .
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office ?
It &apos;d never get through .
All <unk> are <unk> , <unk> and then <unk> for explosives .
You didn &apos;t like my &quot; <unk> money &quot; idea ?
What if we do a <unk> to <unk> .
I was thinkin &apos; about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits .
So what do we do now ?
What about newspapers and magazines ?
Listen to you , &quot; directly &quot; .
You &apos;re not gonna get &lt; u &gt; near &lt; / u &gt; the News Department .
And if you did , it &apos;d never get on the air .
<unk> buried the <unk> film for 15 years .
We &apos;re honest people and we need your help .
I &apos;ll give you two- hundred dollars if you-- No he won &apos;t .
Drive or I &apos;ll blow your fuckin &apos; head off .
Tell him we &apos;re not gonna hurt him .
We &apos;re not gonna hurt you .
Tell me about it .
These guys are incredibly <unk> .
Yeah , I can see where that <unk> Let &apos;s not do the tire thing anymore , okay ?
That wasn &apos;t so hard .
We lost &apos; em .
Oh my God ...
Think we let out enough air ?
I didn &apos;t see a warrant .
Did you see a warrant ?
Those are Feds .
They shouldn &apos;t have come without calling first .
What the fuck ? !
<unk> &apos; em &apos; till they &apos;re almost flat .
And turn your head .
There might be some <unk> flying your way .
<unk> , well , could you walk faster , please .
In the warehouse .
They &apos;re hiding in a <unk> on the third floor .
When we go back inside , they &apos;re gonna kill us .
When they notice that we &apos;re moving toward the car , they &apos;ll come running out of the building .
What &apos;s going on ?
Well , actually , &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; have proof .
Could you walk a little faster please .
Jesus .
Do you have proof ?
The NSA killed him .
Remember when Senator <unk> died in an accident up near <unk> ?
Yeah .
Take a walk with me .
It really is .
Did you find anything ?
That is one ugly sunrise .
Welcome to Santa &apos;s <unk> .
Looks like Detroit .
What do you think ?
Well ... there &apos;d be too much <unk> to <unk> me .
So they ruined my records and made sure I &apos;d never hold a real job again .
They come after you ?
It was &apos; <unk> .
I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid &apos;s class schedule .
So I sold my story to &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; and split .
Why &apos;d you leave ?
That was twenty years ago .
With <unk> ?
They can suck a salt <unk> off a beach .
<unk> has 18 underground acres of computers .
They scan &lt; u &gt; every &lt; / u &gt; <unk> for target words like &quot; bomb &quot; or &quot; President &quot; .
We <unk> phone numbers or voice prints ... whatever we wanted .
When the computers found something , it was <unk> to <unk> analysis .
How &apos;d you have the manpower to-- They can tap anything as along as it &apos;s an <unk> <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> your kid can do .
<unk> calls we &apos;d pick off the <unk> as they were being fed into ground <unk> or fired up to the <unk> .
We &apos;d suck in everything .
All foreign , most domestic .
<unk> was my group .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Anyone we wanted .
How &apos;d you get around the tap orders ?
I <unk> phone calls .
I was a traffic analyst .
You used to work for &apos; em , didn &apos;t you ?
None of your business .
How do you know so much ?
The NSA &apos;s been in bed with the entire <unk> industry since the 40 &apos;s .
They &apos;ve infected everything : Banks , computers , phones , mail , name it .
The more technology we buy into , the easier it is keeping <unk> on us .
It &apos;s a brave new world .
At least it better be .
Oh , I &apos;ll bet &lt; u &gt; that &lt; / u &gt; threw &apos; em off the scent .
I sure hope you covered the <unk> with a <unk> and used a funny voice !
I didn &apos;t use my name .
You don &apos;t get it .
They go through your phone records .
They fuckin &apos; monitor everyone you called in the <unk> I told you no calls .
You told me no calls .
What &apos;d I tell you ?
I called from a <unk> !
What &apos;d I tell you ?
I didn &apos;t use my name .
What &apos;d I tell you ?
I called my wife !
Look , my wife is <unk> I mean did you call anyone .
What do you mean ?
Did you call anyone ?
The price rises with the temperature and right now you &apos;re smokin &apos; .
But you &apos;re right , you should shop around and get the best price .
I &apos;ll just let you out here .
We said a hundred .
I was worried about my hundred and twenty &apos; K &apos; .
And you were worried about me .
That &apos;s nice , I <unk> I taped it off the 11 o &apos;clock news .
You could knock on the door , you know , and I &apos;d open it .
Get dressed .
We &apos;re leaving .
If you find something , chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to <unk> .
It &apos;s South of <unk> .
And take this .
How many years have &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; been hiding from them ?
How many years have you been running ?
What &apos;d they do to you ?
They <unk> your accounts .
Get outa my way .
I &apos;ll pay you .
And you won &apos;t .
Now <unk> What if I find out what they &apos;re after .
You know these people , I don &apos;t .
Look , you gave me some work over the last year .
We &apos;ll call it even .
Hey , if you live another week I &apos;ll be impressed .
What am I gonna do ? !
I mean , like , for the rest of my &lt; u &gt; life &lt; / u &gt; ? !
I don &apos;t know &lt; u &gt; anything &lt; / u &gt; .
<unk> .
They can &apos;t have it .
They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it .
I don &apos;t know what that-- Why don &apos;t they just identify themselves and tell me what they want ?
<unk> , you &apos;re cooked .
It &apos;s over .
What you did , who you were ... that &apos;s done .
I &apos;d find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow .
Wait .
What do I do ?
If I knew , they &apos;d be after &lt; u &gt; me &lt; / u &gt; .
Which they probably are right now .
&apos;Bye .
Why are they after &lt; u &gt; me &lt; / u &gt; ?
It means the NSA can read the time off your <unk> .
I don &apos;t know what that means .
<unk> <unk> .
They use that band for the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know what that means .
Like a <unk> , but two generations ahead of what the police use .
It <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t know what that means .
It &apos;s a <unk> .
What &lt; u &gt; is &lt; / u &gt; that ?
I <unk> this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away .
You drive a black BMW , license plate <unk> ?
That &apos;s who they are .
What do they have to do with this ?
You &apos;ve heard of the National Security Agency ?
Who are they ?
One of many people who would live a word with you .
Who was that other guy ?
You knew the deal .
No contact .
My name &apos;s Neil .
Maybe I can help you .
The thing is ... it really can &apos;t wait .
Jerry &apos;s on vacation &apos; till Monday .
I can give him the message when he gets back .
That was Patrick and the last <unk> It &apos;s Pat Cary .

FBI , CIA , NSA , local cops .
Most of this stuff &apos;s only available to law <unk> .
What are you saying ?
The thing is , Senator , and I don &apos;t want to get in the middle of nothing , but-- What do you mean ?
Who can buy this kind of equipment .
Ah , sir , you know , it &apos;s not for me to say .
Well then who can ?
Well , sir , I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not as simple as that .
Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever , they can &apos;t buy this stuff .
A <unk> <unk> permanently to the Senator &apos;s phone .

Tell me , how &apos;s <unk> ?

Oh , God , I &lt; u &gt; knew &lt; / u &gt; it was stupid , I &lt; u &gt; knew &lt; / u &gt; we &apos;d get caught .
But the <unk> was just &lt; u &gt; sitting &lt; / u &gt; there .
Right on top of the bag .
Yes .
Yes .
We took the <unk> out of the bag , but with every intention of putting it back .

You &apos;d like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift .
I &apos;m married to my wife ... of several years ... and I &apos;d like to buy ... as a Christmas present ... Do you see anything you like ?
Daniel &apos;s life is already ruined .
Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and-- Because my life is being ruined .
Well , I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible .
&lt; u &gt; What &apos;s &lt; / u &gt; your point .
That &apos;s my point .
&lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; footage , for God &apos;s sake .
I don &apos;t see how he could &apos;ve slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in .
I know , but-- I don &apos;t know what &apos;s goin &apos; on with Zavitz , but that was way , &lt; u &gt; way &lt; / u &gt; outa line .
You understand ?
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks .
&lt; u &gt; Yes &lt; / u &gt; , for my wife , what the hell kinds of questions are these .
For your wife ?
To buy lingerie .
Why &apos;d you go to Harrison &apos;s ?

Not that I could see .
Was he with anyone ?
Anything at all ?
Did he give you anything ?
I &apos;m happy to help you all I can .
But I didn &apos;t see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz .
I &apos;ve gotta go to work .
We &apos;d appreciate your cooperation .
Somebody took my blender .
Why so <unk> , Mr. Dean ?
<unk> why don &apos;t you talk to the bus driver ?
I &apos;m just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident .
Because I don &apos;t know .
<unk> why can &apos;t you tell me .
I &apos;m not his attorney .
Are you <unk> attorney / client privilege .
You tell me .
What kind of trouble .
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble .
I &apos;m no expert , but I &apos;m assuming that the <unk> of a moving bus against his body <unk> About the accident .
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died .
I thought you might know something .
I was &lt; u &gt; in &lt; / u &gt; the store , the accident was outside .
It was a bus .
You weren &apos;t at Harrison &apos;s Department Store the night <unk> That &apos;s &apos; cause I &lt; u &gt; wasn &apos;t &lt; / u &gt; there .
A police report .
<unk> said you were there , but I notice you didn &apos;t file a report .
Oh ... yeah , I didn &apos;t see the accident .
No , sir , I &apos;m not involved with that .
I &apos;m doing a quick <unk> on a bus accident took place a few nights ago .
Your name keeps coming up .
Hey , did you guys find my stuff ?

I &lt; u &gt; told &lt; / u &gt; you they could do this .
I &lt; u &gt; told &lt; / u &gt; you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just <unk> Does that hurt ?
I was in a car chase and a small explosion .
Now listen to me : The NSA is behind this .
They think that guy I told you about , Daniel Zavitz , they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be <unk> to them .
So they &apos;re doing all these things &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; .
The bank records , the surveillance .
They &apos;re the ones who broke into the house .
Now I know there &apos;s no reason to believe me .
But I love you .
And I love our son .
So just believe me anyway .
Please .
What happened to your head ?
I don &apos;t think anybody wants the drapes , Stacy , I think the drapes are okay .
This is my house .
Nobody &apos;s kicking me out of my house .
I picked those drapes .
I wish you &apos;d gone to your parents like I asked you .

I think you should leave now , Robert .
It &apos;s not a real picture , Stacy , it &apos;s been <unk> .
It &apos;s not real ... That &apos;s not me .
The date stamp on the picture is last &lt; u &gt; month &lt; / u &gt; .
Is that where you and Rachel conduct business .
I didn &apos;t want you to be upset .
I shouldn &apos;t have lied .
Stacy , there &apos;s nothing between me and Rachel Banks .
You told me you weren &apos;t seeing her at &lt; u &gt; all &lt; / u &gt; .
I see her for business .
You had an affair with this woman , Robert , we went to a fucking &lt; u &gt; counselor &lt; / u &gt; for a year .
I told you I didn &apos;t want you seeing her .
I have lunch with Rachel once a month .
She &apos;s my connection to an investigator .
&quot; At the center of the investigation are <unk> <unk> attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks . &quot;

Stacy , I found out like this .
This is the first I &apos;m &lt; u &gt; hearing &lt; / u &gt; <unk> How could you let me find out like this ?
There &apos;s just , clearly , some <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m sure this is the worst of it .
He &apos;s got his priorities ?
Well , you know-- I don &apos;t understand why Jerry couldn &apos;t clear this up .
Have you been working with Rachel ?
Honey , I don &apos;t like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric .
Yeah , but you said you &apos;ve never met him .
How did you-- A guy named Brill .
Same guy as always .
Who did you work with to get the-- What do you mean ?
How &apos;d you get the information on DePinto ?
A <unk> .
And no terrorist talk at dinner .
You &apos;re <unk> &apos; the kids .
What &apos;d you buy at Harrison &apos;s ?
The thing is , when I saw him , it seemed like he wanted to tell me ... ... he was upset about something and he said ...
Doesn &apos;t matter now .
I &apos;m gonna wash up .
In front of Harrison &apos;s , he got hit by a bus .
I knew him .
The firm did some pro <unk> work for his organization a few years back .
What do you mean ?
I saw a man die .
Something bad happened tonight .
You &apos;re a lawyer .
Don &apos;t you care what &apos;s going on around you ?
I think you &apos;re taking it seriously enough for both of us .
You should take this seriously .
We won &apos;t <unk> the civil rights of the good people .
Just for the criminals .
So you tap everyone &apos;s phone ?
You use computers to probe financial records ?
New Search and <unk> laws ?
Not a very good one , but-- Listen to him .
This guy &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Don &apos;t count on it .
I &apos;m sure we can locate it for you , sir .
My suitcase is gone .
Here , you can use this .
Maybe it &apos;s not connected yet .
It &apos;s a brand new card .
I &apos;m sorry , sir , this card &apos;s been <unk> .
Good news there , Mr. DePinto , you &apos;re talking to one .
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer .
That &apos;s probably not you in the picture .
I tell you what , I &apos;ll just run the thing by the Grand Jury , see if they can &apos;t-- You &apos;re goddam right you jumped the gun .
You &apos;re right , Mr. DePinto , and maybe I jumped the gun .
This is fucked .
You don &apos;t know &lt; u &gt; who &apos;s &lt; / u &gt; in that-- That &apos;s not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine <unk> .
You don &apos;t know who the <unk> That ain &apos;t me .
I &apos;ve got photographs of you at the <unk> <unk> looking <unk> Why the hell would I-- I don &apos;t believe it is , no .

I &apos;ll see if I can , you know , work things out .
And then what ?
My wife &apos;s Jewish .
But that probably doesn &apos;t matter right now .
No , I meant I &apos;m <unk> .
You didn &apos;t squeeze DePinto ?
Actually , that &apos;s not true .
I &apos;d like to speak to someone about what &apos;s happening to me .
I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m not sure I understand .
You wanna fuckin &apos; &lt; u &gt; what &lt; / u &gt; ?
My guess is male , somewhere in his 40 &apos;s or 50 &apos;s .
Any idea what he looks like ?
You &apos;re a moron , you know that ?
It &apos;s not me ?
What makes you think it &apos;s you ?
I &apos;m sorry about that .
I don &apos;t &lt; u &gt; have &lt; / u &gt; a life , Bobby .
I &apos;m in love with a married man .
What &apos;re you gonna do , Rachel ?
You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore ?
You want your job back ?
You want a life ?
This conversation &apos;s over .
I &lt; u &gt; did &lt; / u &gt; care how .
Fuck you .
When you needed information , I got it .
You didn &apos;t care how .
Goddammit , Rachel , you assured me-- I &apos;ve never met him ?
You have to .
Tell me about Brill .
I &apos;m gonna fix it .
You don &apos;t work there anymore , Bobby .
My firm &apos;ll represent you .
Free of charge .
For the last four years .
You being <unk> ?
The <unk> contacted me this morning .
They say my lifestyle and receipts <unk> my income .
Will you hang on just a second .
I gotta go .
Who &apos;s doing this ?
It &apos;s really not a good idea for me to be seen with you .
You got a minute ?
Good .
You &apos;re just what I need right now .
All right , <unk> There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I &apos;ve worked for the mob .
The &lt; u &gt; mob &lt; / u &gt; , Bobby !

My name &apos;s Robert Dean .
I &apos;m an attorney with <unk> , <unk> .
Eat your fish .
I wouldn &apos;t let you .
Good luck with DePinto .
How can I be sure .
I just want to make sure I &apos;m not breaking the law .
He doesn &apos;t work that way .
I &lt; u &gt; like &lt; / u &gt; our history .
And I like you .
I &apos;d probably like &lt; u &gt; Brill &lt; / u &gt; if I ever got to-- Someone with whom you don &apos;t have quite so personal a-- Why would I-- Other than me .
Other than Brill .
I take a straight 15 percent .
Brill &apos;s fee <unk> with risk .
Perhaps you &apos;d be more comfortable using someone else .
Ten thousand cash .
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s Brill &apos;s prices going up or your commission .
So you &apos;ve said .
It &apos;s how he works .
&quot; Soon &quot; .
Or at least sooner than never .
What answer were you-- That wasn &apos;t the answer I was hoping for .
When do I get to meet him ?
Here &apos;s what you asked for .
Brill &apos;s note said it was everything you &apos;d need to , shall we say , coax <unk> Not that much .
Do you like fish ?
I mean it tastes like every other fish I &apos;ve ever had .
Every fish tastes the same .

You may have to what ?
We &apos;d rather not-- Otherwise you may have to what ?
<unk> we may have to-- He didn &apos;t &lt; u &gt; give &lt; / u &gt; me-- We &apos;d like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you-- If he passed me materials , I &apos;d have them .
I don &apos;t .
We have good reason to believe that he passed you-- We believe he did .
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme .
We believe he passed you sensitive materials , possibly with your knowledge , and we need to-- I went through this with an investigator this morning .
If I <unk> I &apos;m an investigator with <unk> Security .
Who &lt; u &gt; are &lt; / u &gt; you people ?
We &apos;d like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz .
I don &apos;t &lt; u &gt; know &lt; / u &gt; you , I don &apos;t &lt; u &gt; know &lt; / u &gt; your name , I don &apos;t know &lt; u &gt; what &lt; / u &gt; the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall , but I &apos;m getting pretty fuckin &apos; &lt; u &gt; sick &lt; / u &gt; of this !

He seems anxious to clear my name .

Until we &apos;ve <unk> this all out .
You &apos;re firing me .
Well until we find , you &apos;re gonna have to take a leave of absence .
Maybe Bellmoth .
Maybe the <unk> .
I don &apos;t know .
Who would do that ?
This is &lt; u &gt; bullshit &lt; / u &gt; .
Someone &apos;s <unk> up a bunch of <unk> to ruin me and to ruin my case .
What &apos;s his name ?
Gimme a week and four guys from <unk> and I &apos;ll have the Post <unk> with us not to sue for <unk> .
Oh , well , that &apos;s true .
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam <unk> in Zurich and that through your <unk> relationship , the <unk> family &apos;s been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to <unk> our case .
I don &apos;t <unk> I got a call this morning from a source I trust .
The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation .
Merry Christmas , son .
<unk> , maybe you didn &apos;t hear Mr. <unk> .
They &apos;ve got models that &apos;ll try on the garments .
Thank you , sir .
I have to go lingerie shopping .
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than <unk> Oil <unk> U.S. <unk> Agency ?
God knows I would , sir , but I have a previous engagement this evening .
My name &apos;s Bobby .
I &apos;m your lawyer .
Don &apos;t do anything &apos; till I talk to you .
Because they &apos;ve been paid off by Bellmoth .
Why would the <unk> The Union &apos;s trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now .
I don &apos;t <unk> That &apos;s because your Union bosses &lt; u &gt; are &lt; / u &gt; those <unk> <unk> .
I &apos;m sorry , Mr. Dean .
But Larry &apos;s in St. <unk> now , so I &apos;m a <unk> &apos;m not myself .
The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth &apos;s offer , it &apos;ll only get worse .
<unk> , in this office I &apos;d prefer you say <unk> .
Last night , Larry <unk> , he works the <unk> Press , he goes to a bar with his wife <unk> to have a glass of <unk> &apos; cause it &apos;s his birthday , and these two guys , these <unk> <unk> , they jump him when he goes to the bathroom .
Well that &apos;s why I &apos;m here , Mr. Dean .
&apos;Cause you &apos;re a labor lawyer .
Because she &apos;s reading the newspaper , you asshole .
She can &apos;t talk to you right now .
What are you <unk> She doesn &apos;t want to talk to you .
No &quot; 900 &quot; numbers .
It &apos;s okay to use the phone .
I &apos;m not goin &apos; anywhere , Eric .

How long can you stay ?
Did you take &lt; u &gt; anything &lt; / u &gt; <unk> at <unk> of those Christmas bags I brought home last week .
Men don &apos;t win fights with women , son , I &apos;ll tell you about that sometime , too .
In the meantime , I &apos;ve got a question for you , and it &apos;s incredibly important that you tell me the truth .
Under no circumstances will I be angry with you .
This is a total <unk> <unk> card .
Ready ?
Who won the fight ?
No .
We &apos;re never getting a divorce .
We were having a fight .
It happens sometimes .
Are you and mom getting a divorce ?
Having an adventure .
I can &apos;t tell you about it right now , but I &apos;ll tell you about it soon .
Where &apos;ve you been ?
Do I know you ?
She &apos;s in the kitchen .

They won &apos;t let me get there .
You go .
You gotta let me bring you in to the police .
No , listen to me .
You gotta let me bring you in .
Listen to me .
I don &apos;t know !
Why would the <unk> I don &apos;t know .
I mean-- Why would <unk> They &apos;re <unk> me .
My stuff &apos;s all over her apartment .
They killed Rachel .
The NSA &apos;s doing this &apos; cause they think I have something .
And they <unk> It &apos;s the NSA .
They &apos;re the ones doing this .
Just be cool .
I &apos;m a labor lawyer .
There are &lt; u &gt; always &lt; / u &gt; mob ties .
Your Bellmoth case .
The FBI thinks there might be mob ties .
He &apos;s heard that it &apos;s <unk> .
An investigation ?
It was a bus accident .
The <unk> &apos;s very happy to have your support , but he &apos;s heard that there &apos;s an investigation .
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars .
You guys didn &apos;t have a table that was in the kitchen ?
That &apos;s what I want to talk to you about ?
Can I talk to you a second ?

They only took electrical <unk> .
Sounds like they didn &apos;t want anything that wasn &apos;t electric ?
No , but they took my blender .
They didn &apos;t take the <unk> ?
I love my blender .
They didn &apos;t take the jewelry .
They took the computers .
They took the big-screen TV , they took my blender .
What about jewelry ?
Why don &apos;t you give &apos; em a call .
Usually they take clothes .
You &apos;ve got a bunch of <unk> suits , they didn &apos;t take &apos; em ?
Did they take your clothes ?
They took the espresso machine .
The &lt; i &gt; espresso &lt; / i &gt; machine , Jerry !
Which makes sense , you know , because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a <unk> before <unk> the stereo .
Yeah , what &apos;s going on ?
Are you still in <unk> City ?
Are you okay ?
How can I reach you ?
Tell me about it .
I need help .
I &apos;m just doing some Christmas shopping .

You think there was a connection to-- I don &apos;t know .
Was Zavitz in trouble ?
I honestly don &apos;t know .
What does that have to do with you ?
He got hit by a bus .
You remember Daniel Zavitz ?
No .
He said they were doing a credit check .
Are you <unk> a loan ?
Dick <unk> got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you .
Because we , and our associates , have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to <unk> lawyers like you , &lt; u &gt; because &lt; / u &gt; of <unk> lawyers like you , and we &apos;d just as soon sit back and <unk> a beer while you get <unk> by as many people as possible .
Yes .
But we can &apos;t .
Well we &apos;d sure like to help you .
Someone &apos;s trying to destroy my life , and I &apos;d like to find out who .
What is it you want ?
Zavitz had <unk> <unk> equipment .
He could &apos;ve downloaded into something .
A disk , a chip , anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with .
Whatever he put it in , he dropped it in that bag .
Then what &apos;s your goddam opinion ?
I &apos;m not asking you to say for certain .
This is what you &apos;re trained to do , right ?
It &apos;s hard to say for certain , these things <unk> What &apos;s your opinion ?
We &apos;re not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom .
I &apos;m not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a <unk> at anything they damn well feel like .
And the next time you have something to say to me , we do it <unk> , in my office , like everyone else .
Now get outa my car , I &apos;ve got a committee meeting on the hill .
There are planes falling out of the sky , buildings blowing up .

Everyone needs to swallow hard .
No one , including you , wants to be <unk> as the one <unk> efforts to crack down on terrorism , and-- You didn &apos;t ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class .
It means who &apos;s side are you on ?
What the hell does it mean ?
&quot; I know thy works and thy <unk> and how thou <unk> not bear them that are evil .
And thou <unk> tried them who say they are <unk> and <unk> found them to be <unk> &quot; .

Jones had to <unk> the scene before we could locate the second body .
We don &apos;t know .

He &apos;s got resources .
All we &apos;ve got is a &lt; i &gt; <unk> billion dollar &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; organization ! &lt; / i &gt; Now god &lt; u &gt; dammit &lt; / u &gt; , Hicks , you find &apos; em .

If he &apos;s with <unk> it means he &apos;s got resources .
Oh , let &apos;s assume that they have .
If they &apos;ve looked at the video .
So they know everything .
And they have the video .
That &apos;s confirmed .
Dean &apos;s with <unk> .
You &apos;re kidding me .
Well ... his real name &apos;s Edward <unk> .
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill &apos;s studio .
One was Dean &apos;s .
The other , we believe , belongs to Brill .
I don &apos;t care if he &apos;s <unk> with Saint Joseph sitting in his &lt; u &gt; lap &lt; / u &gt; .
I want the tape and I want him .
Now is-- I just <unk> No , no , I &apos;m sorry .
I didn &apos;t realize you were hoping to be transferred to a <unk> outside <unk> .
He &apos;s clever ?
He had help ?
Oh .
He &apos;s clever .

I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history .
Why can &apos;t I bring in a man whose name &lt; i &gt; is in the &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; &lt; u &gt; fucking &lt; / i &gt; &lt; / u &gt; &lt; i &gt; &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / i &gt; &lt; / u &gt; ? !

What in hell &apos;s goin &apos; on out there ?
<unk> his credibility before he goes public .
<unk> him .
I don &apos;t want anyone listening to a word he has to say .
Tell me about Rachel Banks .
It was in his bag .
Now it &apos;s not .
He &apos;s arrogant and threatening .
Voice stress points suggest he &apos;s worrying .
We &apos;d have to-- Contact <unk> .

Then <unk> against Zavitz .

Also <unk> .
Pull up the keyhole tapes .
I need to own him .

Several <unk> and one primary who we &apos;ve ID &apos;d as Robert Dean .
A <unk> City attorney .

Sir ?
He never made it to the newspaper , but there was private sector contact .
Am I to <unk> There was a transfer .
We found the <unk> .
What about the tapes ?
He &apos;s dead .
An accident .
Hit by a bus .
The door was open , sir .
I just need a signature .
How &apos;d you get in the building ?
For Daniel Zavitz .
I just need a signature .
Federal <unk> for &apos; Zavitz &apos; .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on , but if you people have <unk> over your own asshole again , you &apos;re not gonna get any help from us .
It &apos;s ending at your <unk> .
It was pulsing on your <unk> <unk> .
He &apos;s carrying the damn &lt; u &gt; flag &lt; / u &gt; .
You have any idea what kind of position this-- This guy &apos;s carrying the &lt; u &gt; flag &lt; / u &gt; for the damn terrorism bill .
You think this is the best time to piss him off ?
The fuck do you have goin &apos; on with Sam Albert ?
We &apos;re not stupid , Reynolds .
Now is that clear ?
Then let &apos;s assume I don &apos;t .
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza ?
I also have tiny pizzas and <unk> stuffed with-- No thank you .
Our Garden , our garden - not so much the garden , but the <unk> alongside it , wild , a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France .
The Devil &apos;s <unk> it was called - The Devil &apos;s <unk> , I don &apos;t know why .
Darling .
My darling .
Tell me about your garden .
Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again .
I &apos;m sorry , Katharine .
Thank you .
Will you bury Geoffrey ?
I know he &apos;s dead .
And a good read .
Don &apos;t waste it .
I promise I &apos;ll come back .
I promise I &apos;ll never leave you .
And there &apos;s plenty of water and food .
You can have a party .
Do you promise ?
I wouldn &apos;t want to die here .
I wouldn &apos;t want to die in the desert .
I &apos;ve always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind , with particular <unk> .
Very English .
And I know exactly where I want to be buried .
In our garden .
Where I grew up .
With a view of the sea .
So promise me you &apos;ll come back for you .
Listen to me , Katharine .
You &apos;ve broken your ankle and I &apos;m going to have to try and <unk> it .
I think your wrist might be broken , too - and some <unk> , which is why it &apos;s hurting you to breathe .
I &apos;m going to have to walk to El <unk> .
Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or <unk> and his camel .
And then I &apos;ll be back and we &apos;ll be fine , and I &apos;ll never leave you .
Shall we be all right ?
I &apos;m just going to find things for the fire .
Don &apos;t leave me !
I know .
I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;ll make a fire .
I &apos;ll be back .
It &apos;s so cold .
Of course .
You idiot .
I always wear it .
I &apos;ve always <unk> it .
I &apos;ve always loved you .
You &apos;re wearing the <unk> .
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk .
Don &apos;t you know you drove everybody mad ?
Why did you hate me ?
I know , darling , I &apos;m sorry .
It hurts too much .
We &apos;ve got to get you out of here .
Please don &apos;t move me .
It hurts too much .
A surprise , he said .
Why did he bring you ?
I can &apos;t move .
I can &apos;t get out .
Katharine !
Oh dear God , Katharine - what are you doing here ?
Do you think you &apos;re the only one who feels anything ?
Is that what you think ?
Dance with me .
I want to touch you .
I want the things which are mine .
Which belong to me .
Dance with me .
You know why ?
He tries to hold her .
She <unk> I &apos;ve watched you - on <unk> , at Garden <unk> , at the <unk> - how can you stand there ?
How can you ever smile ?
As if your life hadn &apos;t <unk> ?
Don &apos;t do this .
Is he next ?
Do you drag him into your little room ?
Where is it ?
Is this it ?
Would you let me pass ?
What ?
What ?
That boy , that little boy , you were holding his collar , <unk> his collar , what for ?
Why did you hold his collar ?
You will .
You will .
I just wanted you to know .
I &apos;m not missing you yet .
She <unk> , can &apos;t find this funny .
Don &apos;t go over it again , please .
I just know - any minute he &apos;ll find out , we &apos;ll barge into somebody we &apos;ll - and it will ill him .
I &apos;m not <unk> .
Don &apos;t think I &apos;m <unk> , because I &apos;m not .
I &apos;d better get back .
Say goodbye here .
Yes .
Yes .
Absolutely .
Shall we be all right ?
Of course .
You didn &apos;t need to slap my face to make me feel as if you &apos;d slapped my face .
That day , had you followed me to the market ?
I don &apos;t care to bargain .
It &apos;s full of <unk> , just in case you think I &apos;m giving it to you to encourage your sewing .
Yes .
A different wife .
This is a different world - is what I tell myself .
A different life .
And here I am a different wife .
Madox knows , I think .
He &apos;s tried to warn me .
He keeps talking about Anna <unk> .
I think it &apos;s his idea of a <unk> chat .
Its my idea of a <unk> chat .
I thought we were against <unk> ?
I can stay tonight .
This - what &apos;s it called ?
- this place , I love it - this is mine !
I &apos;m asking the King permission to call it the <unk> <unk> .
You bastard , I was believing you !
Ouch !
See - you &apos;re always beating me .. !
It &apos;s a long song - <unk> means love … and the story - there &apos;s a Hungarian Count , he &apos;s a <unk> , a fool .
For years he &apos;s on some kind of quest , who knows what ?
And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a <unk> - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave .
He <unk> her clothes , he worships the hem of - It &apos;s beautiful .
What &apos;s it about ?
No , no , it &apos;s Hungarian .
My <unk> sang it to me .
It &apos;s a folk song .
This is - what is this ?
I &apos;m trying to write with your taste in my mouth .
<unk> .
I &apos;ll catch you .
This is empty , just coming !
I can still taste you .
I can &apos;t work .
I can &apos;t sleep .
Lady <unk> calls <unk> .
Say you &apos;re feeling faint - the sun .
Say you &apos;re sick .
<unk> .
Being owned .
When you leave , you should forget me .
A lie .
What do you hate most ?
What do you hate most ?
<unk> - addicted !
<unk> - not with other people !
<unk> .
Your <unk> .
I could go on all day .
My husband .
Alm á sy <unk> .
What do I love ?
I love rice pudding , and water , the fish in it , <unk> !
The gardens at our house in <unk> - all my secret paths .
Okay .
And what do you love ?
Say everything .
When were you least happy ?
When were you most happy ?
That makes it harder still .
A woman should never learn to sew , and if she can she should never admit to it .
Close your eyes .
You don &apos;t sew at all !
You sew very badly .
I &apos;m impressed you can sew .
I believe you still have my book .
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns , <unk> .
Will you please come in ?
Will you not come in ?
No , but I think I do .
Do they know them ?
No , the marriage isn &apos;t a fiction .
And the marriage - is that a fiction ?
Geoffrey &apos;s not in Cairo .
He &apos;s not actually a <unk> .
And the plane wasn &apos;t a wedding present .
It belongs to the British Government .
They want <unk> maps of the whole North Africa .
So I think he &apos;s in <unk> .
In case you were counting on his sudden appearance .
Find that plant .
Cut out its heart .
Water ?
Yes , we have water , we have a little in our can , we have water in the <unk> which can be drunk .
Not at all cowardly , extremely practical .
Come on , come on !
There &apos;s also a plant - I &apos;ve never seen it but I &apos;m told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid .
Of course .
Is it , am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have ?
Could I ask you , please , to paste you paintings into my book ?
I should like to have them .
I should be honored .
Oh my God , the others !
Madox will have <unk> how many miles , they &apos;ll soon turn around .
All true .
Herodotus , your friend , tells of a wind - the <unk> - so evil that a nation declared war on it and <unk> out to fight it in full battle dress , their <unk> raised .
<unk> .
We had a house on that coast and it never <unk> blood .
Go on .
More .
- there is the <unk> , a red wind .
Which <unk> called the sea of darkness .
Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England , <unk> showers so dense they were mistaken for blood .
<unk> checks to see if Katharine is still awake .
Yes is a comfort .
Absolutely is not .
Shall we be all right ?
This is not very good , is it ?
In an hour there will be no stars .
The air is filling with sand .
They &apos;re so <unk> .
I &apos;m just trying to <unk> them .
See what &apos;s happening to them - the stars .
What am I looking at ?
Look over there .
I &apos;m quite all right , thank you .
You should come into the shelter .
And that would be <unk> , I suppose , to feel any <unk> ?
Yes .
Of course it would .
There &apos;s really no need .
This is just a <unk> .
I should feel obliged .
Thank you .
I &apos;d like you to have them .
We took several photographs , there &apos;s no need .
I thought you might paste them into your book .
Ask Al <unk> .
Alm á sy asks Al <unk> in <unk> .
I do not .
You sing .
All the time .
Actually , you sing .
Her or me ?
Be careful ?
You mean you - or me ?
Who ?
He said - be careful .
What is he saying ?
Come on , what did he say ?
The Ostrich is a <unk> .
A poor man <unk> an ostrich , it &apos;s the method .
Nothing to do with Zerzura .
To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move .
The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds , a <unk> , and stands where the ostrich can see him , on the horizon , and doesn &apos;t move , doesn &apos;t eat - otherwise the ostrich will run .
At nightfall , he moves , fifty , sixty yards .
When the ostrich comes the next day , the man is there , but he &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> the ostrich .
Sounds perfectly clear .
Where does the Ostrich come in ?
A mountain <unk> like a woman &apos;s back , a <unk> the shape of an ear .
What do you mean , poetry ?
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich , he &apos;s been telling me about Zerzura , he thinks he &apos;s been there , but his map , the route he &apos;s <unk> , he couldn &apos;t survive the journey now , but he &apos;s a poet , so his map is poetry - and now we &apos;re onto an Ostrich .
I &apos;m telling her your map is poetry .
The <unk> <unk> .
So why follow me ?
<unk> me , by all means .
Following me is <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
As the wife of one of our party .
You felt obliged to .
I was concerned .
As I said , women in that part of Cairo , a European women , I felt obliged to .
After the market , you followed me to the hotel .
Why did you follow me yesterday ?
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this .
I apologize if I appear <unk> .
I am rusty at social <unk> .
How do you find Cairo ?
Did you visit the <unk> ?
I don &apos;t believe that .
I think you are insulted by me , somehow .
You &apos;re a foreigner too , aren &apos;t you , here , in this market ?
That <unk> them .
I don &apos;t care to bargain .
This is not worth eight pounds , Mrs. Clifton .
I don &apos;t want to go back .
You &apos;ve been cheated , don &apos;t worry , we &apos;ll take it back .
Seven pounds , eight , I suppose .
Why ?
They don &apos;t see foreign women in this market .
How much did you pay ?
Hello !
Good morning .
How much did you pay ?
Yes , thank you , Gyges , son of <unk> - Candaules said to him I don &apos;t think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is .
And although Gyges <unk> he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond <unk> that she was <unk> of all women .
Do you all know this story ?
I &apos;m sorry - what have you noticed ?
I can &apos;t sing .
but I can tell a story .
I might need a <unk> .
Do you have your Herodotus ?
I &apos;ve noticed you carry it … What kind of <unk> ?
Isn &apos;t Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of <unk> ?
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it .
Big car , slow car , <unk> car , still a car .
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few <unk> .
And the people here don &apos;t want us .
Are you kidding ?
The <unk> are desperate to get rid of the <unk> … - isn &apos;t that right ?
Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a <unk> .
Isn &apos;t that right ?
Sorry , what &apos;s your point ?
<unk> !
Mustn &apos;t say International .
<unk> word .
<unk> word .
His Majesty !
Die F <unk> <unk> !
<unk> <unk> .
I haven &apos;t , no .
Sorry .
It &apos;s Geoffrey under this .
Have you seen Katharine ?
Why are you people so threatened by a woman ? !
I &apos;ve known Katharine since she was three , my aunt is her aunt , we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife .
I think I &apos;d know what is and what isn &apos;t too much for her .
I think she &apos;s know herself .
All the same , I , were I you I would be concerned - Are you mad ?
Katharine loves it here .
She told me yesterday .
I think the desert is , it &apos;s - for a woman - it &apos;s very tough , I wonder if it &apos;s not too much for her .
Clifton - your wife - do you think it &apos;s appropriate to leave her ?
You too .
Good luck !
<unk> .
The Brigadier , the Brigadier &apos;s wife , the Brigadier &apos;s dogs , the Brigadier at the <unk> , the Brigadier breathing .
What kind of photographs ?
There you have me .
<unk> - that &apos;s my favorite kind of love .
<unk> love of one &apos;s wife .
Still a car .
A broken car ?
No !
NO !
Don &apos;t radio anybody , just give me the fucking jeep !
I understand you are <unk> - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to <unk> - Look , listen to me .
A woman is dying - my wife !
- is dying seventy miles from here .
I have been walking for three days !
I don &apos;t want to spell my name , I want you to give me this jeep !
Alm á sy - would you mind just <unk> that for me ?
What <unk> would that be ?
Count <unk> de Alm á sy .
The Officer is writing this down .
A glance at his <unk> .
Right .
And what &apos;s your name , sir ?
Am I not talking sense ?
- forgive me , I &apos;m , I &apos;ve been walking , I &apos;ve - there &apos;s a woman badly injured at <unk> <unk> , in the Cave of <unk> .
I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society .
If I could just see some identification .
Do you have your papers , sir ?
No , I &apos;m not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too , to come with me , can I take this vehicle ?
I &apos;ll pay , of course - and some morphine and … <unk> miles - I can be back here by <unk> .
I desperately need a jeep .
There &apos;s been an accident .
Yes , of course .
So , <unk> , where have you come from ?
Could I trouble you for some water ?
There is no God .
But I hope someone looks after you .
May God make safety your companion .
Goodbye , my friend .
They shake hands .
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything .
Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all .
I &apos;ll leave the plane in the hangar at <unk> <unk> .
So if you need it … hard to know how long one &apos;s talking about .
We might all be back in a month or two .
Tomorrow afternoon .
Don &apos;t worry .
I &apos;ll be ready .
When &apos;s Clifton picking you up ?
Yes .
It was .
Thanks for the <unk> .
I &apos;ll look after it for you .
We didn &apos;t care about countries .
Did we ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Germans .
None of that mattered , did it ?
It was something finer than that .
I told you so .
<unk> thinks he &apos;ll be <unk> , poor fellow .
I &apos;m going to do what I can , but … And D <unk> turns out to be a great admirer of <unk> .
So now you can say I told you so .
Had a letter from my wife .
The <unk> is still out , which I &apos;m looking forward to .
She says <unk> is <unk> with <unk> Fever .
Wrong coast I should have thought , still … Absolutely right , shut up .
<unk> of apologies all round .
Look , either shut up , or go home .
Good , we &apos;re all here ?
A toast , to the International <unk> club - may it soon <unk> .
I believe I &apos;m rather late .
<unk> the desert .
What do we find in the desert ?
<unk> heads , <unk> .
In a war , if you own the desert , you own North Africa .
Why do they care about our maps ?
Don &apos;t be so bloody <unk> <unk> ve .
You know there &apos;s a war breaking out .
This arrived this morning .
By order of the British Government - all International <unk> to be <unk> by May <unk> .
What &apos;s the matter with you ?
Those maps belong to His Majesty &apos;s Government .
They &apos;re confidential .
They shouldn &apos;t be left lying around for any Tom , Dick or Mary to have sight of .
In my room .
And where are the <unk> <unk> ?
Which we couldn &apos;t explore because of rocks , because of <unk> , it &apos;s sloppy .
And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura .
Which we &apos;ve <unk> twice .
No , because you can &apos;t see from the air !
If you could explore from the air life would be very simple !
Look !
What is that ?
Is that a <unk> ?
That whole <unk> is a real possibility … And I &apos;m telling you there &apos;s nothing there to explore .
Try to get a second <unk> , we &apos;ll bury it between here and the <unk> Hill .
And a better jack .
We planned badly .
I &apos;ll be back as quick as I can .
Thirty-six hours at the outside .
Cut the ropes .
I left a note , on his blanket .
At the next Geographical Society I shall <unk> with great interest the announcement of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The Girl wouldn &apos;t leave , of course .
Her father had sold her for a camel .
He turns over the <unk> , the engine <unk> up .
I was talking about the girl .
I looked at them .
They &apos;re <unk> , small trees .
<unk> .
And <unk> , rock hard .
He walks away to the nose of the plane .
What did you do ?
Her hands and feet were tied .
You shouldn &apos;t go into another man &apos;s tent .
It &apos;s <unk> .
Looking for the <unk> .
Why should we wait until we &apos;re in London ?
This girl was probably twelve years old .
What did you think you were doing in his tent ?
That &apos;s your name <unk> ?
Count Fucking <unk> Von <unk> ?
What &apos;s that supposed to be then , Irish ?
<unk> ?
What are you talking about ?
Who &apos;s <unk> ?
Listen , <unk> , if I have to listen to another word from you I &apos;ll give you a fucking good hiding .
Please - I beg you , I beg you , I beg you , please listen to me , this is a terrible mistake .
Just stop , please , and listen to me .
My wife is dying .
Hey !
Hey !
Stop this jeep !
Let me out of here - there &apos;s a woman dying , there &apos;s a woman dying while I &apos;m - Hey !
Would it ?
She kisses him , very softly , on the lips .
Just kiss me .
It would mean such a lot to me .
No , I &apos;ll get you some tea .
Wait till you &apos;re in Naples .
You &apos;ll find a girl there .
You &apos;re the <unk> girl I ever saw .
Your leg will be fine .
A lot of <unk> came out - I saved you the pieces .
How are you ?
Oh Jesus .
Oh Jesus Christ .
Go !
Hey !
Go !
Caravaggio is in terror .
Don &apos;t cut me .
Come on .
Or was it Toronto ?
Don &apos;t cut me .
Well , you must know .
You were brought up <unk> , yes ?
I slept with the girl .
I &apos;ve got a wife in <unk> .
A girl comes up and points at you , you only see trouble .
Why is there so much nose ?
I can &apos;t hear myself think !
Look - give me something .
So we can all get out of this room .
A name .
A code .
It &apos;s too hot .
A nurse ?
Well , sure , a nurse is great .
A nurse ?
Great .
We don &apos;t have a doctor , but we do have a nurse .
Yes , I &apos;ve been asking for weeks , a month , I don &apos;t know , also my leg was - You are a Canadian spy working for the <unk> .
<unk> Moose .
It &apos;s impossible .
I was buying or selling something .
I &apos;ve been to Cairo many times .
It is you .
This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41 .
And so was this - August 41 .
And this <unk> 42 .
I don &apos;t know .
Is this you ?
I keep <unk> .
You &apos;ve got the wrong man .
My name is <unk> - <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , Caravaggio , both <unk> , I think that is confusing you .
<unk> thief , six months <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
I can get in the back .
She can take you as far as <unk> .
What &apos;s happened ?
Kip !
What &apos;s happening ?
Don &apos;t shoot , please , don &apos;t shoot anybody .
Well , then ask him his name !
<unk> should own music .
The real question is who wrote the song ?
I think that &apos;s called <unk> .
I <unk> it .
Where did you find that ?
Please don &apos;t creep around this house .
Ask him .
Ask your saint who he is .
Ask him who he &apos;s killed .
I don &apos;t know what that means .
I &apos;m one of his ghosts and he wouldn &apos;t even know .
It &apos;s like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in <unk> .
What ?
How could he have ?
When ?
What if I told you he did this to me ?
Who are his ghosts ?
I &apos;m not in love with him .
I &apos;m in love with ghosts .
And so is he .
He &apos;s in love with ghosts .
You have to protect yourself from <unk> .
This is the thing I &apos;ve learned .
You &apos;re in love with him , aren &apos;t you ?
Your patient .
Do you think he &apos;s a saint or something ?
Because of the way he looks ?
I don &apos;t think he is .
I &apos;ll have some of your water .
It &apos;s hot .
Don &apos;t touch me if you &apos;re going to try and fuck me .
Hana ?
Hana ?
Are you alright ?
Some gave me a dress .
You know what &apos;s great ?
What I &apos;m learning ?
You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground .
Everywhere I go , we &apos;re in the right .
I like that .
What do you do ?
What are you doing here ?
You should be happy .
What were you going to do for him when it ran out ?
He pulls out more <unk> from his jacket .
It &apos;s a week .
We didn &apos;t know where you were - or if you coming back , or - Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life ?
I could help you .
I could get you off that .
Where &apos;ve you been ?
<unk> .
Hana calls after him .
Fine .
I &apos;m not looking .
Because we &apos;re fine here .
I don &apos;t know what Mary told you about me , but I don &apos;t need company , I don &apos;t need to be looked at .
I &apos;m okay .
Look , it &apos;s a big house .
We needn &apos;t disturb each other .
I can shoot a pistol !
I &apos;ll sleep in the <unk> .
I don &apos;t care where I sleep .
I don &apos;t sleep .
If you said yes I would have had a reason .
You should let me <unk> those bandages .
Before you go .
So you can shoot a pistol ?
I &apos;d like to stay .
That &apos;s the long and short of it .
I mean , you know <unk> if it &apos;s convenient , if there &apos;s room <unk> .
I have to do some work here <unk> speak the language .
There are <unk> to be - <unk> embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons , you know - while we hug .
I was a thief , so they think I &apos;d be good at that .
So was my Patient .
Yeah , for a while .
You were in Africa ?
They &apos;re fresh .
I haven &apos;t eaten an egg in … have you noticed there are <unk> ?
You get <unk> in Italy but no eggs .
In Africa there were always eggs , but never <unk> .
Who <unk> them ?
I met your friend Mary .
She said I should stop and see if you were okay .
Apparently we &apos;re neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in <unk> .
<unk> , north of <unk> .
Bonjour .
What do you want ?
Are you Hana ?
<unk> &apos; <unk> !
Hana turns , startled and suspicious .
No , now I can &apos;t kill you .
You can &apos;t kill me .
I died years ago .
You get to the morning and the poison <unk> away , doesn &apos;t it ?
Black nights , fucking black nights , when you want to howl like a dog .
I thought I would kill you .
You killed my friends , you ruined my hands .
But the girl was always here , like some <unk> Angel .
Yes , I got back there finally to keep my promise .
To come back for her .
And then of course I couldn &apos;t … I couldn &apos;t even do that properly .
And did you never see Katharine ?
You never got back to the Cave ?
Is that what you thought ?
That I betrayed the British ?
The British betrayed me .
The British betrayed me .
But you were among the British , they were your friends - why betray them ?
<unk> of people did die , just different people .
There was a result to what you did .
It wasn &apos;t just another expedition .
It did this .
If the British hadn &apos;t <unk> your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died .
The rest meant nothing to me .
What did you say ?
I had to get back to the desert .
I made a promise .
The rest meant nothing to me .
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough , the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing .
And you thought you &apos;d come and settle the score ?
Before you went over to the Germans , before you got <unk> &apos;s spy across the desert and inside British headquarters .
He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in <unk> , so they made an impression .
I &apos;d seen you writing in that book .
At the Embassy in Cairo , when I had thumbs and you had a face .
And a name .
So , I come across the Hospital <unk> I was looking for this stuff , and some nurse , Mary , Hana &apos;s friend , tells me about you and Hana , hiding in a <unk> , in <unk> , whatever it is - <unk> - how you &apos;d come in from the <unk> and you were burned and you didn &apos;t know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession - - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and <unk> , and then I knew it must be you .
We shall miss you .
There are going to be <unk> , they want me to interpret , don &apos;t they know I &apos;m allergic to <unk> ?
Hana tells me you &apos;re leaving .
What ?
You and Madox ?
Or you and Katharine Clifton ?
Well , anything you do is likely to be fatal , so you know - I &apos;ve had a drink .
<unk> .
Have a drink .
Is there a song you don &apos;t know ?
What ?
Hana comes in , <unk> , <unk> at the <unk> .
Thought you &apos;d never wake up !
I don &apos;t know .
<unk> .
Is it ?
<unk> ?
I don &apos;t remember .
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it ?
Is it you ?
If I said Moose … I look different , fuck , why shouldn &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t even know if it is my book .
The <unk> found it in the plane , in the wreckage .
It &apos;s mine now .
I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain .
I &apos;m dying for rain - of course I &apos;m dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face .
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything ?
I can &apos;t hide anymore .
I breathe like a dog .
I lose my balance .
Stealing &apos;s got harder .
Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus .
Are you outside ?
A beat and then Caravaggio <unk> in .
Like an old boxer .
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name .
I told her you would never invent such a <unk> name .
And you &apos;ve forgotten yours .
Me ?
You &apos;ve got the wrong end of the stick , old boy .
So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name .
Are you planning to be the exception ?
I think anybody she ever loves <unk> to die on her .
All over ?
I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed .
Are you leaving us ?
Now &apos;s our opportunity to swap war wounds .
Oh , all over .
I understand you were in Africa .
<unk> ?
<unk> , I think , is more accurate .
Finally !
So you &apos;re our Canadian <unk> ?
<unk> !
I think you &apos;ve got <unk> in your hair .
No wonder you &apos;re <unk> .
I do so love you .
What do you smell of ?
Geoffrey , you do so love putting on a <unk> .
Sweetheart , you know we can &apos;t go home , there might be a war .
Can &apos;t we really go home ?
I can &apos;t breathe .
Aren &apos;t you dying for green , anything green , or rain , wouldn &apos;t you die to feel rain on your face ?
It &apos;s Christmas and it &apos;s all - I don &apos;t know - if you asked me I &apos;d go home tomorrow .
If you wanted .
<unk> .
Come on , I &apos;ll take you home .
I &apos;m not pregnant .
I &apos;m hot .
I &apos;m too hot .
Lady H said she thought you might be - I &apos;m fine .
I got hot .
Darling , I just heard .
You poor <unk> , are you all right ?
But finally able to explore the Cairo <unk> .
I shall produce an <unk> guide to the <unk> <unk> and - I want to say <unk> - am I in the right country for <unk> ?
Well look , if nobody minds , truly , then I suppose - I shall , of course , be <unk> … Why do you think ?
About my staying ?
Well , she is !
Darling , for goodness &apos; sake !
I was just saying , I &apos;m going to cable <unk> Street , see if I can &apos;t stir up a few <unk> - Katharine &apos;s mother and the <unk> &apos;s wife are best - The team is in mourning , darling .
Off with his head !
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges <unk> in the shadows .
And though she said nothing , she <unk> .
The next day she sent for Gyges and <unk> him .
And hearing his story , she said this - Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army .
Did Katharine say ?
- Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo .
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine , without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels .
They toast the <unk> .
Very much so .
We are all , save my friend here .
Good heavens , are you married , Madox ?
I won &apos;t hear of it .
None of us will .
Oh no , really .
She has her book .
Of course .
Well , we should all go out onto the <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> .
I think you know all of us , except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton , who &apos;ve recently come out from England .
We can finally <unk> my old bird to the <unk> .
Alm á sy smiles and walks on towards the others .
Isn &apos;t it ?
<unk> present from Katharine &apos;s parents .
I &apos;m calling it <unk> Bear .
Hello .
Geoffrey Clifton .
<unk> plane .
Did you look ?
That was a dance we invented at the International <unk> Club .
Never heard of it .
Who knows the <unk> <unk> ?
Would you like me to ?
Why don &apos;t you go ?
You should sleep .
Don &apos;t depend on it .
Will you ?
That little bit of air , each day there &apos;s less of it , which is al right , which is quite all right .
You &apos;d better be .
I &apos;m still here .
- to her cooking .
Hana was just telling me that you were <unk> - I don &apos;t think it &apos;s <unk> .
I don &apos;t think it does .
Anyway , he &apos;s <unk> to me .
You like him , don &apos;t you ?
Your voice changes .
<unk> milk - one of the truly great <unk> .
<unk> about books .
Kip &apos;s another one .
I &apos;ve been told that before .
Good morning .
Did you know that ?
You &apos;re always singing ?
In that case , I suppose we can &apos;t charge .
They have to clear all the local roads of mines .
That &apos;s a big job .
They won &apos;t stay in the house .
They &apos;re putting up their tent in the garden .
We should charge !
Doesn &apos;t anyone have a job to do ?
With his Sergeant .
A Mr. <unk> .
Why ?
Is he staying ?
I liked it better when there were just the two of us .
My mother always told me I would <unk> my husband by playing the piano .
Really ?
That &apos;s sudden .
I &apos;ll probably marry him .
<unk> .
If he wears a turban , he &apos;s a <unk> .
He wants us to move out , says there could be fifty more mines in the building .
He thinks I &apos;m mad because I laughed at him .
He &apos;s Indian , he wears a turban .
K is for Katharine .
Tell me about this , this is in your <unk> - December <unk> - <unk> in war are <unk> compared with our <unk> during peace .
New lovers are nervous and tender , but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire … I love that , I believe that .
Who is K ?
Yes , of course , I &apos;m so sorry .
Stupid of me .
Hana gets up , upset to have hurt him .
Could I ask you to move ?
I &apos;m sorry - but when you turn , the sheets , I can &apos;t really bear the sheets moving over me .
Sorry .
Do I recognize him ?
I recognize what he is .
I like him .
He &apos;s Canadian .
He can read Italian .
He can catch rabbits .
He keeps asking me questions about you .
Do you know him ?
Do you recognize him ?
That &apos;s a different dress .
He came back , he says he caught a rabbit .
I &apos;m cooking it .
Something smells so rich .
My stomach is <unk> - Please , don &apos;t waste your time on <unk> - This is Captain <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Well then - yes .
Of course .
No , I can &apos;t go , but if it , if you weren &apos;t offended , it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed .
This is as private as we &apos;ll get .
Just go off .
I &apos;ll be quite all right .
He &apos;s going back to the front this evening .
I can &apos;t see him otherwise .
Can I ask - my friend , can he come in ?
Just for a few minutes ?
Excuse me - He won &apos;t disturb us then .
I think he &apos;s after morphine .
There &apos;s a war .
Where you come from becomes important .
And besides - we &apos;re vulnerable here .
I keep hearing <unk> in the night .
<unk> .
Me ?
He can &apos;t .
I &apos;m already disturbed .
He needn &apos;t disturb you .
Why are people always so happy when they <unk> with someone from the same place ?
What happened in <unk> when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you ?
Why ?
Can he lay eggs ?
There &apos;s a man downstairs .
He brought us eggs .
He might stay .
Because I &apos;m a nurse .
Why are you so determined to keep me alive ?
Are you crazy ?
Could I have a cigarette ?
Are you <unk> more ?
I can see my wife in that view .
No sand .
That &apos;s your drugs speaking .
Zerzura , the White City of <unk> , the <unk> of Little <unk> .
As me about the scent of <unk> - it &apos;s in this room .
I can smell it .
The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth .
I can taste it .
I &apos;m chewing the <unk> .
Is there sand in my eyes ?
Are you cleaning sand from my ears ?
I &apos;m turning you .
Not the window - I can &apos;t bear the light anyway - no , I can see all the way to the desert .
I &apos;ve found the lost <unk> .
How ?
How can you see anything ?
I can already see .
I should try and move your bed .
I want you to be able to see the view .
It &apos;s good , it &apos;s a view from a <unk> .
Yes .
<unk> off .
Are you asleep ?
When my wife comes to lie down she always <unk> her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room , and from where you stand you will be able to <unk> on her at your <unk> … I &apos;m not laughing at you .
Go on , please .
Candaules … you &apos;re laughing at me .
I will hide you in the room where we sleep , said Candaules .
She <unk> over the word .
Oh - I &apos;ve found <unk> .
We have <unk> in the <unk> .
We have an <unk> !
She has <unk> a plum and now <unk> it into his mouth .
My book ?
The Herodotus ?
Yes , we can read him .
I think they &apos;re all in Italian , but I &apos;ll look , yes .
What about your own book ?
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me ?
I was <unk> the stairs .
I found a library and the books were very useful .
What was all the banging ?
Were you fighting rats or the entire German army ?
Because you &apos;re leaning ?
No , you &apos;re just on an angle .
You &apos;re too heavy !
There was a Prince , who was dying , and he was carried up the tower at <unk> so he could die with a view of the <unk> Hills .
Am I that Prince ?
Hana laughs .
Where &apos;s your <unk> from ?
Somewhere near there , isn &apos;t it ?
I love you .
I &apos;m not sewing anything else for you !
Hana , I know you do !
You don &apos;t have any money , do you ?
Just in case there &apos;s silk .
I &apos;m not sewing anything else .
There &apos;s meant to be <unk> in the next village - the boys are taking me .
So one day we &apos;ll meet .
I &apos;ll always go back to that church .
I &apos;ll always go back to that church .
Look at my painting .
Then come with me .
I &apos;ve <unk> to you .
I &apos;ve <unk> to you .
Kip .
Life a <unk> .
I &apos;m thinking about your heart , not your skin .
And how to reach it .
And that I don &apos;t think I can .
A bomb has ruined us , just not the bomb I thought would ruin us .
It &apos;s what I &apos;ve learned .
Is that what you think ?
Is that what you think I think ?
I know - here I am always a brown man , there you would be always a white woman .
Kip … I - I mean home .
India .
Of course .
When ?
Will you come with me ?
This is hot !
The lamp was burning all night in his room .
Caravaggio was there with him .
I should go to the house , get breakfast .
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on , the waste - I &apos;d been taught to <unk> everything , the <unk> from a cow to cool a <unk> , a fork to fix a <unk> - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away .
That gun at <unk> , <unk> &apos;s cannon - <unk> - remember ?
That was made out of the metal of ordinary things .
I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns .
His <unk> is thrust into the <unk> .
It &apos;s red hot .
What are you up to ?
You wouldn &apos;t come to find me ?
That makes me never want to come here .
But she continues <unk> the turban .
Then I &apos;d think there must be a reason .
But if it got late and I hadn &apos;t shown up ?
I try not to expect you .
If one night I didn &apos;t come to the tent , what would you do ?
You loved him .
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday !
- the Patient , <unk> : they &apos;re everything that &apos;s good about England .
I couldn &apos;t even say what that was .
We didn &apos;t exchange two personal words , and we &apos;ve been together through some terrible things , some - he was engaged to a girl in the village !
- I mean - and us - he never once … He didn &apos;t ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the <unk> or - I don &apos;t even know what I &apos;m talking about .
Kip - come and dance with me This is what I do .
I do this every day .
Don &apos;t go .
I &apos;m frightened .
I can love a coward , I can &apos;t love another dead man .
Don &apos;t talk .
Check again .
Lie flat and then cut .
Kiss me .
Before I cut .
Just in case .
No .
But he hands them over .
Actually , you can &apos;t cut , can you ?
You &apos;ll fall over .
Give me the <unk> .
You must get away .
Before I cut .
I &apos;m not cutting if you &apos;re here .
He &apos;s struggling .
He &apos;s going to <unk> over if he cuts .
I &apos;m not scared .
So many people have died around me .
But I would be a shame for us .
I don &apos;t feel like being shy .
Okay .
Get away from here .
Quick .
I promise you that was the right thing to do .
He &apos;s my good luck .
Now cut .
This one .
I hope we don &apos;t die .
What is this business with you and explosives ?
Do you think you &apos;re immune ?
I &apos;ve done this .
I &apos;ve had to do this .
Why would anyone do this ?
I follow the wires .
You get <unk> .
So I follow the wires ?
There &apos;s a mine here , but the others are far enough away , I think at least to give me a chance .
I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over .
What do I do ?
The mines , the wires , there &apos;s a trick .
Some explode if you stretch the wires , some if you cut them .
It &apos;s okay - I &apos;ll help .
Please .
I didn &apos;t like that book either .
It &apos;s all about men .
Too many men .
Just like this house .
I &apos;ll get another tin .
Hana and the Patient are alone .
Yes , for your hair .
For my hair ?
Try this .
I found a great <unk> of it .
Olive oil .
In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife .
I don &apos;t think so .
I &apos;ve met you before .
No , but , no , not at all .
I &apos;m sorry .
You came to the doors , that &apos;s all and - - such good manners for someone worried about mines .
That &apos;s all .
Is something funny ?
I see .
Then may be you &apos;re safe as long as you only play <unk> .
He &apos;s German .
Kip is looking around the piano .
Hana <unk> .
The Germans were here .
The Germans were all over this area .
They left mines everywhere .
<unk> were their favorite hiding places .
Excuse me .
Yes ?
I don &apos;t have the key to that door .
Oh God .
Oh God .
No .
He &apos;s - no .
He &apos;s gone , hasn &apos;t he ?
Does he know a Captain <unk> ?
The boy hears this , <unk> to Oliver .
Third Canadian <unk> .
He &apos;s from there - edge of Lake <unk> right , Soldier ?
If anything happened to you I &apos;d never forgive myself .
He can &apos;t even move .
And what if he really is a spy ?
I need morphine .
A lot .
And a pistol .
It &apos;s not safe here .
The whole country &apos;s crawling with <unk> and Germans and God knows what .
It &apos;s madness .
I can &apos;t allow it .
You &apos;re not , this is natural - it &apos;s shock .
For all of us .
Hana - When he dies I &apos;ll catch up .
It &apos;s not over everywhere .
I didn &apos;t mean literally .
The war &apos;s over - you told me yourself .
How can it be <unk> ?
What if you couldn &apos;t find him … ?
Sergeant , not today , please .
Not this morning .
Does he have to go ?
A bomb .
At the <unk> .
She closes the door , then <unk> .
I &apos;ll tell him .
What is it ?
Is it a mine ?
Only we have to go to work .
I was looking for the Lieutenant <unk> .
You saved my life .
I haven &apos;t forgotten .
I thought you were very very tall .
You seemed to big - a <unk> - and I felt like a child who can &apos;t keep her balance .
I &apos;ll ask the Lieutenant .
But thank you .
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear , so please .
Very kind of you , we can always eat in the town with the others - I was going to say - if you want to eat with us , ever … you and Lieutenant <unk> … I &apos;m feeling old .
I thought that was for when we were very very old ?
I had a hotel room .
I was looking forward to this evening .
A bit of one .
You &apos;ve got a mustache .
We can do that when we &apos;re very , very old .
I &apos;d like to spend a night with you in a bed .
I &apos;ve got a surprise .
A boat !
We can go to <unk> .
It &apos;s got a cabin , it &apos;s private .
Sorry .
I took a <unk> .
Whoa - give me a chance !
This is making me incredibly angry .
You &apos;ve got to cut , sir , that <unk> won &apos;t last .
I &apos;m afraid so , sir .
Kip <unk> to his tent .
Hana follows him .
What &apos;s happening ?
Am I needed ?
Don &apos;t move !
Stand <unk> <unk> !
Hana stops .
Hey !
Hey !
Stop !
Hey !
I insist .
There clearly isn &apos;t room for us all , I &apos;m the least able to dig , and I &apos;m not one of the walking <unk> .
Those are facts .
Besides , if I remain it &apos;s the most effective method of <unk> my husband to abandon whatever he &apos;s doing and rescue us .
It &apos;s hard to argue with this logic .
Darling , Peter says I could stay … A more modest expedition , or even wait a year .
Remind our families we still exist .
How awful .
What will you do ?
I &apos;m afraid we &apos;re not having much luck <unk> funds for the expedition .
Not at all .
I was thoroughly enjoying by book .
Please .
Signor D <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Mrs. Clifton , you &apos;ll have to forgive us .
We &apos;re not <unk> to the company of women .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
Really .
I think I can <unk> through .
Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges .
King Candaules was <unk> in love with his wife - One day he said to Gyges , the son of somebody , anyway - his favorite warrior - Your book .
Your Herodotus !
Alm á sy looks uncomfortable .
No , please .
I shall be absolutely fine .
They pass Alm á sy , who doesn &apos;t look up from his book .
I &apos;ll come with you .
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes .
How romantic .
With <unk> I fell over every five minutes .
Ronnie <unk> me Lady <unk> .
I don &apos;t think so .
You should sit down , darling .
She &apos;s quite all right .
Are you pregnant ?
Coming .
I can &apos;t sleep .
I woke up shouting in the middle of the night .
Geoffrey thinks it &apos;s the thing in the desert , the trauma .
Go on , do it .
I don &apos;t need to hear any more .
They &apos;re excited !
They &apos;re happy about destroying a whole city .
Would they do that to a White Man &apos;s City ?
Never !
What have I been doing all this time ?
Do you know how many mines I &apos;ve seen ?
- more mines than there are soldiers , more - how many mines we &apos;ve put in the ground ourselves , stuffed in <unk> , dropped out of the sky .
And now this .
What are you talking about ?
I looked up to you , Uncle .
My brother always said I was a fool .
Never trust the British , he said : the <unk> , the <unk> ; never shake hands with them .
What &apos;s he saying ?
This is wonderful !
Hana , we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
What I really object to , Uncle , is your finishing all my <unk> milk .
And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be <unk> by the British .
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he &apos;s writing about ?
It &apos;s still there , the cannon , outside the museum .
It was made of metal cups and <unk> taken from every household in the city as tax , then melted down .
Then later they fired the cannon at my people - <unk> - The natives .
- The Wonder House <unk> as the natives called the <unk> Museum .
<unk> platform opposite the old <unk> - I think so .
Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans .
Might I have a glass of water ?
Then you were married ?
Or my wife &apos;s .
This was your garden ?
You tell me .
I remember a lot of things .
I remember a garden , plunging down to the sea - the Devil &apos;s <unk> we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom , right on the shore , nothing between you and France .
How do you know you &apos;re not German if you don &apos;t remember anything ?
Why ?
Are you German ?
Am I being <unk> ?
You should be trying to trick me .
Ask me about Tottenham <unk> .
Or <unk> Palace .
About <unk> - I was addicted .
Or make me speak German , which I can , by the way .
No .
I think I was a pilot .
I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the <unk> .
I was with them for some time .
What about your rank or serial number ?
I &apos;m going to get him , I promise you .
Tell me where you are , or just leave the line open so I can trace you .
Too late now .
Listen to me .
Whatever you &apos;re doing , stop .
Pull out .
He &apos;s on to something bigger .
In the middle ?
You &apos;ve got the Mask , why don &apos;t we have him ?
I &apos;m in the middle .
Gin ?
Where the hell are you ?
I &apos;ll send you a postcard .
Got to go .
Where are you at least ?
Look , trust me .
I know what I &apos;m doing .
Don &apos;t <unk> yourself .
You , want to blow the whole thing , go right ahead .
This is dangerous .
I &apos;m sending backup .
I don &apos;t know , but close .
We &apos;re getting close .
Yeah yeah yeah .
What &apos;s the status ?
This was my first excuse to get away .
I can &apos;t exactly use my cell phone .
You don &apos;t call , you don &apos;t write .
Which you have in mind .
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest .
I &apos;d need an introduction .
From someone he trusts .
Someone who owes us a favor .
How would you approach him ?
Hello , Mr. <unk> , I &apos;m Gin , would you steal a painting with me ?
I &apos;ve been following this guy for years .
I &apos;m your best shot .
With that <unk> better .
Out there ... it &apos;s different .
You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue .
It &apos;s not the thinking of it , it &apos;s the doing it .
Why didn &apos;t I think of that ?
We &apos;ve got to catch him in the act .
You got a better idea ?
They &apos;ve never caught him before , what makes you think they &apos;ll catch him now ?
You &apos;re saying the thief wants us to think it &apos;s Mac but it &apos;s really not .
Give me a break .
Remember <unk> ?
When he stole <unk> &apos;s <unk> he left a <unk> <unk> bottle .
The best ones always copy Mac .
Put the bolts on that window under a scope , I &apos;m betting you &apos;ll find <unk> <unk> on them .
And the draft blew over the flowers .
Meaning no one <unk> <unk> like that .
He left the window open when he came in .
His only mistake .
Let a thousand flowers <unk> .
Chairman <unk> .
You <unk> <unk> <unk> again ?
Interesting theory .
Where &apos;s the proof ?
He <unk> the bolts , <unk> them on <unk> , then <unk> the whole frame away .
No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor .
That &apos;s great if you &apos;re a computer .
In the real world that <unk> weighs 200 pounds .
The building &apos;s <unk> feet high .
So he <unk> the <unk> ?
<unk> through the doors or <unk> <unk> <unk> alarm .
The windows don &apos;t open .
Through a window .
A thief this good could handle the <unk> in the rooms .
What we don &apos;t get is how he <unk> his entry .
I don &apos;t recall asking your permission .
I don &apos;t recall <unk> you to have a personal life .
I hardly knew the guy .
Why be impolite to strangers ?
You didn &apos;t answer the beeper either .
There are times when you don &apos;t answer the phone .
Where were you ?
I called at 4 : 30 this morning .
You mean the seven billion .
You gave them the eight billion .
They &apos;ve been on to you all along .
<unk> you had a big job going .
That would be <unk> .
The cop I work for every now and then .
<unk> thieves .
The really good <unk> ones who imitate me .
He looks familiar .
Both sides of the street , I &apos;m afraid .
<unk> &apos;re a cop .
You have the right to remain silent .
But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you-- What about you ?
It &apos;s only ninety seconds up the line .
You &apos;re on a connection to a <unk> <unk> express .
Take the airport subway , but change at Jordan Station for <unk> <unk> .
Nothing is wrong .
Everything is the way it has to be .
In my left coat pocket is a packet .
<unk> , hotel reservations , tickets .
I &apos;m not leaving without you .
Put this on !
No , you can &apos;t .
I cannot get rid of you .
Get out of here !
You can do it .
I sincerely hope not .
The door &apos;s the only way out !
We can &apos;t help it , we ... we &apos;ve gotta ...
The disc is still in there .
MOVE IT , WHAT ARE YOU <unk> F ... We can &apos;t leave it IN THERE , it &apos;s got all our accounts , everything that can <unk> us to a goddam <unk> ! ! !
Don &apos;t panic , now , there &apos;s no rush ...
Relax , don &apos;t jam it ... <unk> <unk> midnight , happy new year .
Except at China Bank .
Jesus God , it &apos;s going through .
They &apos;ll each be positive the other guy did it .
I fear an ugly international incident .
China will think it happened before midnight .
Britain will swear it happened after midnight ... And when , eventually , everyone <unk> what <unk> <unk> was really about ... <unk> us luck once , maybe it will again .
The sign of our partnership .
I &apos;m leaving from the <unk> Road Station at 6 : 30 tomorrow morning .
You could come too .
They drive so <unk> there .
I &apos;m going to disappear .
I die in a car crash in <unk> .
Very easy to do .
What ?
Another job ?
Stealing the Eiffel Tower ?
Not for me .
A flaw in your research , my dear .
I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast .
That &apos;s because you grew up rich .
Seen one billion , seen them all .
Four billion dollars .
Oh , I don &apos;t care about the money .
So what are you going to do with your share ?
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention .
Of course not .
It was just a negotiating <unk> .
Have really held you under ?
But would <unk> you-- But that &apos;s all behind us now .
It was wrong to <unk> you .
That was a lifetime ago .
Call it a new tradition .
You have something in mind ?
There is one more thing .
Can &apos;t break tradition .
It &apos;s bad luck .
You shouldn &apos;t have .
No .
You &apos;ll see when we get inside .
No way to take another day or two ?
Done .
And I assume you have the magic <unk> <unk> ?
Let me guess .
His <unk> plate is in there .
Two men in the world don &apos;t need passwords or codes .
Their <unk> will scan to unlock everything .
one of those two men is the chairman of the bank .
Can &apos;t be too careful .
<unk> codes to the vault are changed daily , passwords for our computer on the hour ... Like a woman of mystery .
How do I look ?
For God &apos;s sake , the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump .
Look , there &apos;s a video security system to bypass , that &apos;s the only hard part .
You &apos;ve done that a dozen times .
You &apos;re <unk> yourself again .
What &apos;s worse , this time you &apos;re <unk> me .
I &apos;ve covered everything .
And you &apos;re the best , so-- There &apos;s always a surprise .
There &apos;s no way to practice this .
And no time .
Besides , I &apos;ve planned it all .
There aren &apos;t any surprises .
You &apos;re out of your mind .
We can &apos;t do a job like this with no rehearsal .
That &apos;s the beauty of it .
There &apos;s only one tiny window of time when this will work .
At the <unk> of <unk> <unk> Britain to China .
The <unk> from them to us .
You can &apos;t be serious .
We &apos;re doing it tonight .
So how long till we do this ?
You &apos;ve thought of everything .
That &apos;s where the Mask comes in .
Then the vault , how to get in the vault , that &apos;s <unk> me .
It &apos;s no good without the <unk> gas .
The <unk> &apos;s already programmed .
Sit down , I &apos;ll show you how we &apos;re going to do it .
A <unk> gift from the Empire .
Nope .
The <unk> <unk> the computer to replace those instructions with an <unk> loan coded <unk> .
But those instructions , they &apos;re recorded in the computer .
Every wire transfer gets <unk> through a series of multiple switches .
As soon as each deposit lands somewhere , it &apos;s shot somewhere else .
It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn &apos;t find it .
And the money <unk> It &apos;s taken me five years at <unk> Insurance , nights , weekends , every spare minute , to make this <unk> .
It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest <unk> out of thousands of those accounts , two , or three million at a crack .
Total , eight billion and change .
Where the money is .
<unk> China Bank .
<unk> <unk> of every <unk> party on turnover night .
They &apos;d be handy to disappear into , so we &apos;re invited to all of them .
Right .
The eight billion .
The eight billion .
From them to us .
<unk> data so we can do <unk> <unk> at the moment of transfer .
You &apos;re being useless .
I &apos;m making us rich .
Well ... What are we doing ?
My job , my rules .
What about the rules ?
I &apos;d taken the Mask ?
Oh my god , I <unk> Would you quiet down !
Just for a minute ?
Do you know what you &apos;ve done ! ?
Do you know ?
You took the Rembrandt , I figured it was a fair trade .
The Mask .
Where is it ?
There &apos;s food in the fridge .
I won &apos;t be long .
<unk> hands , the devil &apos;s workshop .
Everyone has secrets , it &apos;s what makes us human .
Okay , look , I &apos;m delivering this to a man who &apos;s going to give us the key to our job .
But it &apos;s pointless to try to explain it yet .
You just have to trust me .
I don &apos;t have any more secrets .
<unk> thing , wondering if your partner ... has another partner .
I told you .
It &apos;s the down payment .
And thanks to you it &apos;s <unk> .
Sure , it &apos;s only worth 25 million or so , don &apos;t bother telling me what you &apos;re going to do with it .
I &apos;ll need the Rembrandt now .
You &apos;ve got everything planned .
I always knew you &apos;d do the job .
Hold the record .
Alone .
Come on , what can you do with six billion you can &apos;t do with four ?
It &apos;s <unk> , less the cost of the dress .
My eighty , your twenty , smart guy-- No , really , it &apos;s your plan , you should get at least 30 per <unk> If you want a partner , I think you should <unk> the split .
Speaking of money .
You said billions .
How many ?
I like banks .
That &apos;s where the money is .
You don &apos;t know the half of it .
We &apos;re living history here .
Get the hell in .
A billion dollars .
There is no big job .
The big job .
It &apos;s your mistake .
STOP !
You &apos;re making ... mistake .
What do I need a thief for ?
I &apos;ve got the Mask .
Okay , you &apos;re a thief .
No , no , please God , you &apos;re wrong .
I &apos;m a thief .
Just like you .
You &apos;re playing both sides of the street .
You &apos;re going to keep the Mask and turn me in .
Now &apos;s when you tell me who you really are .
We did it .
Be careful not to break the laser <unk> .
They moved it .
Can you see the other <unk> ?
Yes , you can .
You can spoil a perfectly nice dance .
You can &apos;t be too careful .
These rooms are solid stone .
They haven &apos;t changed .
Don &apos;t turn .
I &apos;m counting the steps to the entrance .
You &apos;re not on the beat .
One , two , three ... Let &apos;s <unk> a little , shall we ?
It &apos;s a party .
In eye of that painting .
<unk> , on <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the-- He pulled back his arms and <unk> , I landed right on the floor .
I picked myself up , tears in my eyes , and he looked at me and he said , Son , don &apos;t ever trust anybody .
Anybody .
Something like that .
So you had to be your own <unk> .
My father told me not to be afraid .
He &apos;d always be there for me .
Aren &apos;t we all .
I had a <unk> .
If I &apos;ve got a <unk> , I &apos;m okay .
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then ?
<unk> .
Still am .
You were afraid of heights ?
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El <unk> .
Three thousand feet of <unk> .
Straight down .
I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton .
I couldn &apos;t talk , just stood there <unk> ... like this .
You &apos;re nervous again .
To us .
To the Mask .
Little celebration before we set off .
Aren &apos;t we early ?
I &apos;ve got something for you .
Certainly the most beautiful crook I &apos;ve ever seen .
Straight down the drive , right at the <unk> , follow the lane .
Don &apos;t blink , you &apos;ll miss it .
Won &apos;t take any time .
It &apos;s not a village .
There &apos;s nothing there .
No , no , I want to .
I &apos;ll just go into the village .
Don &apos;t get any ideas .
Of course it comes out of your share .
You bought this for me ?
I trust it &apos;s your size .
One more <unk> on the check list .
That &apos;s it .
We &apos;re ready .
The lipstick <unk> camera ?
A dozen times .
And you &apos;ve checked the <unk> to be sure it &apos;s <unk> with the clock .
Twenty four <unk> long as it takes the clock to strike twelve .
So how long to pop the floor ?
Yes you did .
I didn &apos;t mean to get personal .
It was a long time ago .
All this , this is a woman &apos;s version of what you would like .
Our equipment has arrived .
Did I hear a car ?
Try laps .
Say a hundred .
Let &apos;s do it again .
We are ... for the tools .
Why don &apos;t we take oxygen ?
Oh , I think you can do it .
Probably .
So you &apos;re testing &lt; u &gt; me &lt; / u &gt; now ?
Let &apos;s just see how we do .
So the Mask is part of the down payment too .
Must be a really big job .
Without the Mask it doesn &apos;t matter .
A partner with secrets isn &apos;t much of a partner .
We get the Mask I &apos;ll tell you .
On what ?
Another job ?
No .
It &apos;s a down payment .
Don &apos;t worry , I can get rid of this .
No trace .
And I &apos;ll even go fifty fifty , we &apos;re partners aren &apos;t we ?
This isn &apos;t a good time to hear your personal philosophy .
No one &lt; u &gt; needs &lt; / u &gt; anything except food and shelter .
The rest we just want .
I &apos;ll need that .
You &apos;re too easily impressed with yourself .
I believe I &apos;ve made that point before .
Someone was expecting that .
It was perfect .
The <unk> was quite good .
You need a partner for this job .
You &apos;ll never find one as good as me .
I <unk> the bolts and went in through the window .
It was the only way to bypass the smart glass .
I wondered who &apos;d been giving me a bad name .
That &apos;s because I wanted them to !
Nice try .
Everyone thinks I did .
No , dammit !
I mean me !
That Rembrandt ... that Rembrandt !
A <unk> problem , I &apos;m afraid .
You don &apos;t have any idea how lucky you are !
This isn &apos;t some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer &apos;s <unk> room .
Look , I can help .
You need a <unk> expert .
You &apos;ve got one .
Pack up .
I &apos;ll see you get back to London .
You don &apos;t get the Mask code unless I go .
I go in alone .
Precisely .
You give me the Mask security code , I steal the Mask , you get a <unk> fee .
At ten percent , should be two or three million at least .
Not too bad .
We &apos;re doing this together .
We &apos;re partners .
We ?
Are you implying that I &apos;m taking you inside ?
We go underwater ?
So the Duke dug a <unk> in case .
They made the lake a hundred years later .
<unk> the tunnel .
That &apos;s when we &apos;ll do it .
And we &apos;ll need every single day .
They &apos;re having a farewell party the last night .
Before the Mask goes back to <unk> .
Only a week ?
In a week .
Years ago , if memory serves .
When does the exhibit end ?
As I recall , you &apos;ve robbed it before .
I know it well .
It is .
Coffee and <unk> or whatever you eat in the kitchen .
We &apos;ll start in twenty minutes .
And good morning .
My job , my rules .
We &apos;ve got a job to do .
No <unk> business and pleasure .
Why are we in <unk> know , separate rooms ?
I guess I have a more <unk> view of human nature than you do .
Nothing ?
You don &apos;t even lock the door ?
Hmmm .
I &apos;d be surprised if you could .
I &apos;m impressed .
Can &apos;t spot a thing .
I &apos;m just curious what sort of security system you &apos;d have in your own house .
You really don &apos;t believe I &apos;d take on a partner after all these years without a little ... insurance ?
What &apos;s my problem ?
You want a list ?
What &apos;s your problem ?
I &apos;m doing the job .
I don &apos;t believe this .
No .
<unk> is what cops do to robbers .
Where &apos;s my bag ?
I &apos;m a thief .
Sue me .
You stole my luggage ?
<unk> Certainly not mine .
Come on .
Those are my clothes .
I never carry ... <unk> .
What about your bags ?
I &apos;m not the one to ask ... We &apos;re going to die , aren &apos;t we ... We &apos;re only going one way .
It &apos;s one way .
Not bad .
I didn &apos;t expect you to make it out .
What the hell was that ?
Up to you .
You could tell him the check is in the mail .
What the hell do I do now ?
Damn , I knew I forgot something .
He says they turned the card down .
That &apos;s what you &apos;re buying .
Put it in your pocket .
A film case .
Look on the back .
What do you see ?
I &apos;m telling you it &apos;s a <unk> .
The paint &apos;s still wet for God &apos;s sake .
Can you follow simple directions ?
Give him the card .
It &apos;s a fake .
I &apos;m paying ... one point five million and change .
I hate round numbers .
How much am I paying ?
It &apos;s simple .
You pick up the painting , you pay for it with this <unk> card .
Fine .
What do I do ?
That &apos;s my girl .
It &apos;s a test .
If I can &apos;t trust you to pick up a painting , how can I trust you about the Mask ?
I &apos;m not here to run errands .
I &apos;m here for the Mask .
Quite a good one .
A <unk> .
Not major , but it is <unk> .
You want me to pick up a painting ?
Not a word .
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes .
Maybe I should drive this time .
We going somewhere ?
It &apos;s only on exhibit at the Queen &apos;s Museum this month .
Even if you could get into the museum , the Mask <unk> its own security system .
A special , randomly programmed <unk> code .
Besides , if I <unk> certain <unk> <unk> about the <unk> of <unk> I do <unk> wouldn &apos;t need a partner , much less a <unk> girl .
I &apos;d do it myself .
<unk> has a vivid imagination .
But <unk> <unk> So you &apos;ve heard all those stories about me .
Well , I can assure you they &apos;re not true .
And if they were true , I &apos;ve retired .
It &apos;s not for sale .
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest .
That old pirate <unk> <unk> <unk> personally took this to <unk> when he was run out of China in <unk> .
Peking would dearly love to have this back ...
<unk> better than that temple scroll you were bidding on .
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China .
The Empress Death Mask .
I &apos;m sorry .
This just means so much to me .
For God &apos;s sake .
Good .
I &apos;ll call the <unk> .
They can get you a new room , book your flight home , so forth .
Are you under the impression that now I &apos;m in some way <unk> to you ?
We were , we are , but this is perfect for you .
And I thought we were getting on so well .
Oh , that &apos;s quite all right .
No charge .
I &apos;ve got something for you .
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born .
You fall apart when you don &apos;t get your own way .
No .
Why would I be ?
You &apos;re shaking .
Are you nervous ?
Of course I can .
I have a note from mother .
Do you mind ?
I didn &apos;t expect you to be so ... Oh , I &apos;m taking you ... quite seriously .
You &apos;re not taking me seriously .
I sincerely hope so .
I &apos;ve got something ... Of course you wouldn &apos;t .
The Rembrandt wouldn &apos;t fit .
Like I would have art in my suitcase .
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable .
You are in the business , that &apos;s what <unk> says .
Yes .
But they don &apos;t have a clue .
Why would anyone steal my luggage ?
You &apos;re joking .
You can &apos;t trust anyone these days .
I don &apos;t care about the damned car .
My luggage &apos;s been stolen .
That &apos;s good .
Terrific .
It was only a scratch .
Far more <unk> to my trousers than to me .
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely .
It &apos;s nothing serious .
I &apos;ll just run into that building .
They &apos;ll have some sort of first aid kit .
I &apos;ll call an ambulance .
Seems I am .
Meet me in front .
Five minutes .
You have a car ?
Something of great value , something of such artistic and <unk> <unk> that only you could truly appreciate ...
Believe me , if you weren &apos;t so <unk> , I &apos;d have one for you .
I have a proposal for you .
I don &apos;t want to waste your time .
Where did you hear that , one of those American talk shows ?
Check , please .
I &apos;m sorry about the scroll , but sometimes you have to lose to win .
You &apos;re like <unk> .
Once you get it , you can &apos;t get rid of it .
How about if you try disappearing .
How about if I try humility .
No you can &apos;t .
A billion people speak Chinese .
Don &apos;t be too impressed with yourself .
As for that scroll , I can <unk> it for double .
In 30 minutes .
Uh .
I &apos;m showing off .
Why are we speaking Chinese ?
That is of no interest .
Who am I ?
I have a question ...
Tomorrow .
It has to be tomorrow .
Or forget the Mask .
You should know , when I come back here with the <unk> anything goes wrong , a detailed description of everything you &apos;ve done goes to the <unk> .
Always in a rush .
We need to make the trade tomorrow .
A true master .
Classic , yet extremely sexual , don &apos;t you think ?
Yeah .
Probably not .
I been meaning to tell you , far as I &apos;m concerned you &apos;re over the hill .
Yes it does .
Takes a lot out of you , one like this .
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces , you know ?
And they don &apos;t come off .
But when you find the one person who really knows you , and then you lose her ... My friend , you always surprise me .
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote ?
The night she died ?
I really don &apos;t think that &apos;s a topic on which you have much to offer .
You got a real problem with priorities , you know that ?
The face <unk> , the mask doesn &apos;t .
Art <unk> , we don &apos;t .
That &apos;s why art &apos;s so valuable .
It &apos;s a little piece of <unk> .
I figured that out .
Take this mask .
It may look like the Empress , but it &apos;s not .
You don &apos;t really think I &apos;d leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag ?
What matters isn &apos;t what &apos;s real .
It &apos;s what we &lt; u &gt; think &lt; / u &gt; is <unk> matters is the art .
Thought you had to use some of these .
Call it an expression of trust .
You &apos;re giving them to me ?
<unk> next <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , not <unk> .
<unk> : one million each .
She won &apos;t tell me everything .
It &apos;s a bank job , that &apos;s all I know .
<unk> is angels dancing on the head of a pin .
I got to have trust .
You &apos;ll just have to have faith .
To yourself , that &apos;s where .
You know where my <unk> lie .
You better be keeping your mind on business .
It &apos;s not just me you got to worry about .
I &apos;ve got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder .
It &apos;s never happened before .
What makes you think it &apos;s happening now ?
My <unk> is up , it is fully extended , and I am picking up ... what is it ?
It is , can it be ?
The boy is in el , u , <unk> She reminds you of yourself .
There &apos;s nobody you admire more .
She &apos;s good .
Give her that .
Almost as good as she thinks she is .
You &apos;re impressed with her , aren &apos;t you ?
She &apos;s calling the shots now .
I &apos;m waiting for the tell part .
This is just show and tell .
That &apos;s because we live in the future .
Which is what &apos;s on my mind .
It &apos;s not just art , it &apos;s history .
Something you Americans don &apos;t care <unk> you haven &apos;t got any .
Doesn &apos;t look like much .
How come those <unk> want it so bad ?
Check out my ball .
Tonight your league night ?
I &apos;m terribly sorry old man .
You damn well thought wrong .
Oh , look at me , darling .
I thought this gentleman was a waiter .
You change partners , you change the rules .
<unk> , after all these years ?
You better not be taking on a new partner .
We &apos;re supposed to .
You two make quite a couple .
Because it pays off .
Remind me why .
So patience , <unk> , patience .
Trust me .
But the second mouse gets the cheese .
The early bird gets the damn worm .
It &apos;s too soon .
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie .
She &apos;s selling you a pig in a poke .
We better do this tonight .
You look like George Washington .
How the hell I &apos;m supposed to know the damn difference ?
I said a <unk> ball , not a costume party .
It better be worth it for me .
Oh , it is .
This better be worth <unk> .
I &apos;d say she &apos;s a size 6 who wears a size 4 .
Black of course .
That &apos;s it , I sure as hell ain &apos;t no personal <unk> .
I need you to get one more thing for me .
A dress , elegant but sexy , something Grace Kelly would wear .
Maybe a <unk> .
Because I never assume anything .
It &apos;s a death mask .
Death mask means dead .
Let me ask you , this Mask , when they made <unk> the old bitch dead or alive ?
It &apos;s never big enough .
This is big enough .
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet .
She has another job after this one .
A big one .
You are a miracle worker .
<unk> is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days .
If we don &apos;t bypass it , the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm .
That would be inconvenient .
Sure wouldn &apos;t want you to be uncomfortable .
We &apos;re going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust .
The air <unk> might be wired .
And a bypass hose for the <unk> .
You &apos;re not the one trying to get all this shit .
You think they &apos;ve just got a <unk> R Us on every corner ?
The key to success is using the right tools .
Had to get a liquid <unk> screen .
The <unk> power ... <unk> <unk> ... got the <unk> / <unk> camera ?
And you do it so well .
Yeah , the lord of the <unk> doesn &apos;t haul his own <unk> .
I &apos;d give you a hand but it wouldn &apos;t look good .
Don &apos;t go getting sentimental .
You &apos;re no damn good at it .
Tina was a wonderful woman .
In the van .
They work off the <unk> tank just like the slice pack .
Next time I &apos;ll use valet parking .
I &apos;m not real big on collecting banged up <unk> at <unk> .
I &apos;m gonna assume that was meant as a compliment , Anna , and just say thank you .
Um , Erin ?
Listen .
Even though you &apos;re not necessarily my favorite person in the world ... ... sometimes you &apos;re not <unk> .
Don &apos;t use language with me -- What the fuck did you do with my stuff ?
Where &apos;ve you been ?
Erin , you &apos;ve been here three weeks .
If you don &apos;t know how to do your job by now , I am not about to do it for you .
Anna ?
With this <unk> <unk> stuff - - could you remind me , cause I &apos;m a little confused about how exactly we do that .
That &apos;s a joke , right ?
Oh , hell .
I &apos;m <unk> .
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files .
That way , at any time , we can find out a case &apos;s status -- where it is in the office , stuff like that .
We file &apos; em all here , <unk> -- Hey , excellent .
Thanks .
Tell you what , why don &apos;t you go on over to reception , tell them I said <unk> should take you to the airport .
Thanks .
I &apos;ll keep it in mind .
Mr. Masry , before you go off on some <unk> , you might want to remember who it is you &apos;re dealing with here .
PG &amp; E is a <unk> billion dollar corporation .
250,000 is all I &apos;m authorized to offer .
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here .
A million things could have caused those problems .
Poor diet , bad genes , irresponsible lifestyle .
Our offer is final and more than fair .
You &apos;re kidding , right ?
Look at these <unk> for Christ &apos;s sake .
PG &amp; E &apos;s own <unk> <unk> toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test <unk> , on <unk> occasions .
I understand they &apos;ve had a bad run of luck , <unk> , and they have my <unk> .
But that &apos;s not PG &amp; E &apos;s fault .
What about in terms of medical expenses ?
250,000 doesn &apos;t come close to what this family &apos;s gonna have to spend on doctors .
In terms of land value out in Hinkley , Mr. Masry , we feel it &apos;s a more than fair price .
All of them .
All of &apos; em ?
<unk> these to this number , okay ?
What &apos;s she doing here ?
Nothing you can &apos;t show up for with a stain .
I didn &apos;t mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor .
Jesus .
Look at me .
What do I have this afternoon ?
It &apos;s those files you asked for .
What the hell is this doing here ?
Right .
<unk> are people too .
You shouldn &apos;t judge , <unk> .
Erin Brockovich .
Car accident .
Not her fault , she says .
And she looks like such an honest girl , don &apos;t you think ?
Whoa .
Remind me .
He &apos;s a low-life .
Speaking of which , that &apos;s your nine o &apos;clock in there .
<unk> isn &apos;t a friend ; he &apos;s a client .
Tequila .
From your drug dealer friend .
What do you think ?
What &apos;s this ?
His dry cleaners .
You want him ?
Oh , Jesus .
Who &apos;s responsible for his pain and suffering this time ?
That asshole smashed in my fucking neck !
An <unk> doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control -- He came tearing around the corner , out of control -- So you say .
What ?
Hey -- &lt; u &gt; he &lt; / u &gt; hit &lt; u &gt; me &lt; / u &gt; .
What &apos;s your point ?
So .
You must &apos;ve been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon .
Yeah .
There &apos;s two .
Why ?
There &apos;s more than one ?
<unk> thousand in debt .
Whew .
Is your <unk> helping out ?
... or lemme guess -- toxic waste ?
Usually , in adults , it &apos;s from exposure to <unk> or a virus or ... How does someone get <unk> ?
She must be a tough cookie , cause it &apos;s a pretty advanced case .
I &apos;d say she &apos;s been walking around with it for a few weeks now .
It &apos;s an <unk> of the <unk> cord and part of the brain .
<unk> ?
What the hell is <unk> ?
Oh my God .
Oh my God .
And get someone to help around the house .
Any school you want .
I can put them in a good school .
It &apos;s enough -- for whatever you need , for whatever your girls need , for whatever your girls &apos; girls need -- it &apos;ll be enough .
I don &apos;t even know how much money that is .
Five million dollars .
Five million dollars ?
And he &apos;s making them give five million of it to you all .
Oh , my God .
A number for the whole group , or for us ?
The judge came up with a number .
Well , then -- if you &apos;re feeling up to it , maybe we should talk shop .
It &apos;s a good day .
I feel good .
Well , I was gonna head over to the <unk> now .
I was thinking -- <unk> really values your opinion ... You wouldn &apos;t happen to have a little time right now , would you , Donna ?
Sure you are .
You &apos;re just a happier woman , cause you don &apos;t have to deal with <unk> and <unk> .
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea .
You think if you got no <unk> , and no breasts , you &apos;re still <unk> a woman ?
Right , but -- didn &apos;t you say he was paid by PG &amp; E ?
No .
Hunh-uh , see , that &apos;s not what the doctor said .
He said one &apos;s got absolutely nothing to do with the other .
I know .
But the <unk> I been talking to ?
He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure .
And everything you all have is on that list .
Well -- then it &apos;s gotta be a different than what &apos;s in our water , cause ours is okay .
The guys from PG &amp; E told me .
They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine .
And you say this stuff , this hexavalent chromium -- it &apos;s poisonous ?
It was right up on the PG &amp; E property over there .
An <unk> monitoring well ?
That means -- Not around here .
This is a rough part of the world .
Hard times , not a lot of money , not a lot of luck .
It &apos;s a challenge , staying healthy in a town like this .
Heck , even our dogs up and die .
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick .
I thought the same thing , right off the bat .
That &apos;s why we went to see the doctor .
But <unk> .
Turns out one &apos;s got nothing to do with the other .
Well , hell , maybe that &apos;s why you all have been so sick -- It &apos;s a chemical they used over at that <unk> station up the road there .
The chromium .
Well , that &apos;s what kicked this whole thing off .
Cause of the chromium .
Wow .
Why would they do that ?
You bet .
Paid for a <unk> for the whole family .
And not like with insurance where you pay , then wait a year to be <unk> , either .
They just took care of it .
Just like that .
We never even saw a bill .
Well , they paid for the doctor &apos;s visit .
Right , but -- I &apos;m sorry , I don &apos;t see why you were <unk> with PG &amp; E about it in the first place .
Are you kidding ?
With how our lives are , if I start <unk> files , I &apos;ll be sunk .
I just kept all PG &amp; E <unk> in one place .
Yeah , I can see that .
I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren &apos;t important , but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff ?
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don &apos;t get me wrong , I &apos;d be glad to move to some better place , but if they aren &apos;t gonna pay us properly , I just don &apos;t see the point .
I &apos;ll say .
Holy <unk> .
Thank you .
It &apos;s in <unk> now , thank the Lord , but you never know .
And then while that &apos;s going on , I end up having to have a <unk> .
Plus a whole mess of <unk> removed from my breasts .
All benign so far , but still , no matter how positive you stay , an operation can still take it out of you .
Yeah , I &apos;m real sorry to hear that .
I know .
They &apos;re more than a bit unusual .
See , two years ago , Pete got <unk> &apos;s disease .
That &apos;s a kind of cancer -- Yeah , I &apos;m real glad you brought that up .
I was going through your file here , and I ran into these medical records .
They kinda surprised me -- Cause first you gotta move , then there &apos;s <unk> , and if the windows aren &apos;t the same size , you know -- you &apos;re making all new curtains .
Honest to God , I don &apos;t know if I have the energy .
You know , I &apos;ve been sick .
Me and Peter both have .
Thank you .
I think so too .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m being such a <unk> on this house price thing .
I don &apos;t mean to be a pain in PG &amp; E &apos;s <unk> , especially after all they &apos;ve done for Hinkley , but I look around here and I think , if they want this place , they &apos;re gonna have to pay for it .
And I don &apos;t just mean pay for the house ; I &apos;d like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over .
Yeah ?
I should learn to do stuff like that .
They make the place feel real <unk> .
I added air conditioning , put in the pool , made all those pillows by hand ... Well it oughta be , with all the work I put into it .
This is a real nice place you got here .
Hell , no .
I hate lawyers .
I just work for them .
You got a minute ?
You &apos;re a lawyer ?
I &apos;m Erin Brockovich , from Masry &amp; <unk> ?
Hi .
Donna <unk> ?
The firm took in sixty .
That &apos;s three percent .
Seemed like a fair bonus to me .
Two million dollars ?
What is that ?
Okay , fine .
&lt; u &gt; Fine &lt; / u &gt; You <unk> me into a corner again .
You &apos;re holding me hostage ... Ed , I swear , I &apos;m not -- &quot; I can always find someplace else to work .
<unk> that &apos;ll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ... &quot; I wasn &apos;t gonna -- The extortion , the threats ...
Here what comes ?
Oh , okay .
Here it comes .
Yeah .
Yours is nicer .
You see your office ?
Careful you don &apos;t spit from here ; you could kill someone .
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying , do the right thing .
Give him another chance .
How do you know that ?
But I know you &apos;re not gonna quit on me .
The <unk> son of a bitch in the universe , Erin .
The <unk> son of a bitch in history .
Say you &apos;d be the <unk> son of a bitch on Earth if I didn &apos;t up and quit over all this .
I did .
Both .
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself .
I was wrong .
Say you were wrong .
I don &apos;t know what to say .
Oh , now don &apos;t get all jealous , Ed .
I got a little something for you , too .
Ho - <unk> - shit .
You know what , Mr. <unk> ?
I completely forgot your birthday this year .
And seeing as how you &apos;ve been so good to me , I think that is a terrible oversight .
So what I been doing over the last few days is I &apos;ve been putting together a present for you .
Erin ?
What are you -- No , I &apos;m serious .
You know what Kurt <unk> is ?
He &apos;s the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place .
He &apos;s the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG &amp; E offered 20 million .
He doesn &apos;t work like us , Ed .
There &apos;s no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing .
Because Kurt doesn &apos;t want to work with you .
He thinks you &apos;re a loose cannon .
This isn &apos;t doctor &apos;s orders .
It &apos;s mine .
I &apos;m saying you can &apos;t come .
The fuck I &apos;m not .
I don &apos;t care what the doctor says -- You &apos;re not gonna be there .
Okay , good .
I think I should be the one to tell &apos; em , cause they trust me more than -- Tuesday at seven , at the Hinkley <unk> .
&lt; u &gt; I know &lt; / u &gt; .
We &apos;re having a meeting , it &apos;s all set up -- Fuck legal terms .
We &apos;re talking about human beings here .
Sick people .
A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years .
They need their money now !
We gotta get &apos; em to agree to the <unk> , Ed .
We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to -- Hey , that &apos;s not so bad .
<unk> it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago , and those people still haven &apos;t seen a dime .
So in legal terms , ten years is -- I &apos;m sorry , are you saying that if this thing goes to trial , it &apos;ll be &lt; u &gt; ten years &lt; / u &gt; before these plaintiffs see their money ?
Five years , maybe , for a trial .
Double that for the appeal .
Wait , what do you mean , ten years ?
Because .
They know the evidence ; they know they &apos;re gonna lose a jury trial .
Maybe they wouldn &apos;t lose 400 million bucks , but once you factor in all they &apos;d spend on this case in the next ten years , it makes a lot of -- So why would PG &amp; E offer it ?
With nothing <unk> it to the corporate offices yet , I &apos;d say we &apos;ll end up on the lower end of that .
Still a lot of money .
And if you had to guess ...
Between 50 and 400 million , definitely ?
I know .
I &apos;m sorry .
Do I get to hear what happened anyway ?
I &apos;m not gonna fire you .
I wanted to .
But then you got sick , and that woulda made me look like a shit .
You embarrassed me , Erin .
If you &apos;re here to fire me , your timing &apos;s lousy .
<unk> ?
Jesus -- &lt; u &gt; <unk> &lt; / u &gt; ?
Don &apos;t give me that .
You &apos;ve gotten plenty .
You &apos;ve been <unk> ; you &apos;ve gotten lots of <unk> ... Bullshit .
You stuck me in <unk> <unk> to some God damn <unk> clerk so you could finish this thing without me .
After all I &apos;ve done for you , that &apos;s the thanks I get .
No one &apos;s taking anything -- How dare you take that away from me .
&lt; u &gt; Not personal &lt; / u &gt; ?
That &apos;s my &lt; u &gt; work &lt; / u &gt; in there , Ed .
My sweat , my labor , my time .
If that &apos;s not personal , I don &apos;t know what is .
Okay , now you &apos;re making this personal , and it isn &apos;t -- &quot; Fun ? &quot;
Jesus , &quot; &lt; u &gt; fun &lt; / u &gt; ? &quot;
I kill myself for a year and a half , hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver <unk> , remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place , and you think of me as &quot; fun ? &quot;
You &apos;re emotional .
You &apos;re <unk> .
You say any God damn thing that comes into your head .
And I &apos;m not saying that &apos;s bad .
That can be great ; that can be a lot of fun -- And , what , I &apos;m not serious ?
Look , this is serious now .
They &apos;re talking serious money -- Kurt thought ?
What about you ?
Do you think anymore ?
Okay , look .
It &apos;s an important meeting .
Kurt thought , if it was just lawyers -- Bullshit .
You &apos;d drag me off my <unk> if it suited you .
Look , you said you weren &apos;t feeling great .
I thought you should rest .
People don &apos;t fly down in their own god damn plane for &quot; just a meeting &quot; -- Erin , it &apos;s just a meeting .
If you tell me to relax , I &apos;m gonna kick your fucking head off -- Gee , I wonder why .
Not in my world .
Because &lt; u &gt; that &apos;s how people treat each other &lt; / u &gt; !
Why the fuck should I respect her ?
Bullshit .
It was a misunderstanding .
But instead of handling it <unk> , instead of treating her with respect -- She insulted me !
He &apos;s got a reputation for doing all his -- <unk> PG &amp; E thinks it shouldn &apos;t go to -- It &apos;s PG &amp; E saying to the judge that we don &apos;t have a case .
Their lawyers go -- What &apos;s a <unk> ?
Don &apos;t joke .
They might .
So do me a favor and behave yourself for once .
Ed Masry to see Kurt <unk> .
Holy shit .
Who do they represent , God ?
It &apos;s eight million dollars , Erin .
Eight million dollars .
Plus , 40 percent of 20 million &apos;s a whole lot of money .
Maybe .
but maybe not .
We still don &apos;t have anything <unk> this to PG &amp; E corporate .
Plus , there &apos;s the <unk> problem .
Plus , we &apos;re way short on manpower , so we &apos;d need to bring on more lawyers ... Do you think we &apos;d do better by going to trial ?
And it &apos;s less than pocket change for PG &amp; E.
... but it won &apos;t cover <unk> Daniels &apos;s medical bills .
I &apos;m thinking ...
I wish someone else had to make this decision .
50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic <unk> has gotten .
Ever .
But ...
So what are you thinking ?
It &apos;s about 50 thousand per <unk> .
Whoa .
No shit .
Things like the head counsel for PG &amp; E calling me with an offer .
20 million , plus attorney &apos;s fees .
Take it or leave it .
What kind of things come up ?
You might want to think real hard about the amount , too .
My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now , cause I still don &apos;t make enough to afford good child care .
Makes me think about looking around for a job where I &apos;m appreciated , for shit &apos;s sake .
I &apos;ll see what I can do .
I want my paycheck .
By the end of the day .
Is that what you want ?
Fuck you .
Make time .
Cause I bust my ass for you .
I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet , for you .
And what do you do for me ?
Huh ?
You see the way I &apos;m treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once ?
Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I &apos;m doing ?
Have you ever bothered saying , hey , Erin doesn &apos;t get paid the most cause she has the best tits ; she gets paid the most cause she &apos;s the best God damn employee I &apos;ve ever had ?
Erin , you &apos;re a big girl .
If you got a problem with Jane , work it out for yourself .
I don &apos;t have time to deal with -- It &apos;s my paycheck .
Which I earned .
Which I deserve .
Which I shouldn &apos;t have to beg for .
That <unk> bitch won &apos;t give it to me .
Oh , Jesus .
You wanna tell me what the problem is here , or -- Yeah , I mind .
You bet your ass I mind .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here -- Do you mind ?
I want my fucking money -- Yeah .
Yeah , I &apos;m ... fine .
I was just asking .
Are you all right ?
No , Ed -- what with me running for my life , I didn &apos;t have time to check those things -- He &apos;s gone .
Did you get a license plate ?
Or a make ?
I don &apos;t know .
Big .
Dark .
What kind of truck ?
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone , then he followed me , like , two miles .
Jesus , I &apos;m shaking .
Get me a beer .
Someone &apos;s following me .
Boy , this job takes me to some of the best damn places , huh ?
He said he &apos;d be at the gas station at six .
D &apos;you get his name ?
Course not .
Jesus , Ed -- Hey .
A new <unk> called , wants to meet you .
I told him we &apos;d be out there Thursday .
They &apos;re trying to intimidate us .
Tell them to wait in the conference room .
Jesus .
They look like the Secret Service .
Yeah , I heard that one before .
From their tone of voice on the phone , I &apos;d say they &apos;re taking us more seriously .
If they &apos;ve sent that little <unk> <unk> again , I &apos;m gonna be real pissed off .
Well , good , Ed .
I like working with you too .
Hey .
I like working with you .
I would now .
You didn &apos;t care about my case ?
Me too .
That &apos;s why I like it .
It &apos;s been a long time since I had a case I cared about .
Really ?
It makes me sick .
I like this case .
Jesus Christ , Ed -- you know , the more I work on this thing , the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is .
Here we got a company that poisoned a whole <unk> -- that built a pool for a town , then filled it with toxic water -- and &lt; u &gt; we &apos;re &lt; / u &gt; the ones who &apos;ve gotta bust our ass proving things ?
That &apos;s just not right .
Then they didn &apos;t know .
And if they didn &apos;t know , we can &apos;t hit &apos; em for <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> is where the money is .
Show me the document that proves that .
Oh , they knew .
They had to know .
PG &amp; E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley .
What do you mean ?
We &apos;ve got the PG &amp; E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls .
But nobody &apos;s getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG &amp; E fuckers in San Francisco .
Don &apos;t give me that .
You &apos;re gonna get plenty rich off of this , Mr. 40 percent .
We got those PG &amp; E fuckers by the balls here .
Hey , I got a staff to pay , plus rent , plus I haven &apos;t billed a minute of my time since I started on this case , so you can quit hitting me up like I &apos;m rich or something .
Yeah ?
Then gimme another raise .
Erin -- lemme tell you something .
If I <unk> put three <unk> on this , I wouldn &apos;t expect them to dig up all the information you got here .
This is some damn good work .
For your information , Frank cares what was in those ponds &apos; cause he used to spend half his day <unk> around them .
That was his job .
Jesus .
I don &apos;t even wanna ask what you did to make this <unk> guy talk .
I guess it was a little too inconvenient .
So for fourteen years , this stuff <unk> into the <unk> , free as you please .
They skipped that step .
See , according to this , they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn &apos;t <unk> into the ground .
But guess what -- It didn &apos;t help , but no .
The real problem &apos;s on the bottom .
And that &apos;s what caused the <unk> ?
They covered &apos; em over .
And not too carefully either , cause you dig one inch under the surface , and the dirt is green as a fucking <unk> .
I don &apos;t remember seeing any ponds up there .
They used the <unk> <unk> here , in these cooling tanks , as an <unk> .
Then they dumped it here , in these six ponds .
You wanna talk about -- She lived on the <unk> .
You never know .
Is that what I think it is ?
Another raise wouldn &apos;t hurt .
And with all the time I &apos;m gonna be spending on the road , I &apos;ll probably be needing my own <unk> phone , won &apos;t I ?
Yeah , yeah .
Remind me of that when I &apos;m filing for <unk> .
You &apos;re doing the right thing , Mr. Masry .
Kinda like David and what <unk> &apos;s whole fucking family .
Okay , here &apos;s the deal -- if , and only if , you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I &apos;ll do it .
I &apos;ll take it on .
Kinda like David and what <unk> ?
This is a whole different ball game , Erin .
A much bigger deal .
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from <unk> .
A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then .
You think there &apos;s more ?
Four more .
Eleven people .
So far .
How many families we talking about here ?
Okay , fine .
I don &apos;t know shit about shit .
But I know the difference -- Oh , you do ?
With all your legal expertise , you believe that ?
We can get these people .
With a little effort , I really think we can nail their asses to the wall .
I know how DNA works , Erin -- And this shit is bad news , Mr. Masry .
Not only does it attack every organ of the body , it fucks with your DNA , too .
That means these people &apos;s genes , and the genes of their kids , and the genes of their grandkids -- -- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it .
-- It &apos;s about being realistic .
Something like this , Erin -- it could take forever .
They &apos;re a huge corporation .
They &apos;d completely bury us in paperwork .
I &apos;m just one guy with a shitty little <unk>
firm .
It &apos;s not about working hard -- Okay , so here &apos;s what I &apos;ll do .
I &apos;ll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the <unk> people you &apos;d ever hope to meet , who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I &apos;ll tell them we can &apos;t help them cause you don &apos;t feel like working that hard .
Because I said no .
Look -- the only reason PG &amp; E &apos;s even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate <unk> .
We add plaintiffs , and suddenly we &apos;re in the middle of a toxic <unk> -- with a <unk> problem -- against a massive <unk> .
No , thank you .
That &apos;s crazy -- why not ?
Hunh-uh .
Absolutely not .
And I realized , he &apos;s taking a chance too .
Then I don &apos;t get anything either .
I &apos;m the one who &apos;s injured , and this <unk> who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward ?
Boy , do I know how you feel .
First time I heard that number , I said you got to be kidding me .
Forty God damn percent ?
Yeah .
Isn &apos;t that a shame ?
Mr. Masry , <unk> gets lost going to the bathroom .
They &apos;ll be driving around the valley for hours .
What , you think I &apos;m made of money ?
And you can &apos;t ?
Because they can .
You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal .
They can afford to waste all the time in the world .
I don &apos;t get why they &apos;d do that .
That wasn &apos;t an offer .
A million would &apos;ve been an offer .
When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off , waste my time , it &apos;s a fuck you .
At least they made an offer .
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice .
So you think we got &apos; em scared ?
I &apos;m telling you , the minute <unk> sent the fax -- I &apos;m talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG &amp; E claims department is on the phone to me , <unk> a meeting .
So far .
But that place is a pig <unk> .
I wouldn &apos;t be surprised if there &apos;s more .
This is the only thing you found ?
A ten percent raise and benefits .
But that &apos;s it .
I &apos;m drawing the line .
Ten .
There &apos;s a lot of other places I could work .
Okay .
A 5 % raise , and -- Look , Erin , this is not the way I do business , this extortion nonsense .
I want a raise .
And benefits .
Including dental .
Lemme see it , will you ?
Course I did .
That document you found , the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn &apos;t happen to make a copy did you ?
Boy , you musta really <unk> it then , huh ?
And &lt; u &gt; you &lt; / u &gt; fired &lt; u &gt; me &lt; / u &gt; .
Jesus .
I didn &apos;t see any medical records in there .
The ones in the box of files .
The box of files ?
The one from your office ?
What medical records ?
It doesn &apos;t take a genius to look at those medical records and think something &apos;s wrong .
So what made you think it was ?
They told her something , but it can &apos;t have been too specific , cause I talked to her , and she sure didn &apos;t think her water was bad .
But , PG &amp; E told her about the chromium ?
You wanna know , you gotta hire me back .
I got a lot of bills to pay .
So what &apos;s the story on this thing ?
This cancer stuff ?
Boy , are you ever a shitty judge of people .
I don &apos;t know .
Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun .
Now , why in the hell would you assume that ?
Look , I &apos;m sorry .
You were gone .
I just assumed you were off having fun .
Well , that was nice of him .
Isn &apos;t it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give &apos; em the ax ?
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium , is <unk> parts per million .
And that at the rate you mentioned , <unk> , it could be responsible for the <unk> in that family you asked about .
The <unk> .
I got an interesting call this afternoon .
It was from a Dr. <unk> .
What are you doing here ?
Bullshit .
You &apos;re trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed .
Fuck if I &apos;ll help you do that .
Come on , I &apos;m trying to help here .
Okay , enough -- Now , look , Erin -- this incident aside , I don &apos;t think this is the right place for you .
So what I &apos;m gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf .
Find you something else , okay ?
That &apos;s not how we work here .
You don &apos;t just leave a message and take off .
I left a message .
I &apos;ve been dealing with that real estate thing .
I was gonna write up a whole damn report and -- Erin , you &apos;ve been gone for a week .
I guess I &apos;m not the right kind .
How come you &apos;re not at lunch with the girls ?
You &apos;re a girl .
You &apos;re a girl .
Yeah .
I got it .
No problem .
You do know how to do that , don &apos;t you ?
Oh .
Huh .
Well , look , I got this file I need valued .
Real estate thing .
A lady has some property next to a PG &amp; E plant that PG &amp; E wants to buy .
I need to know what to ask for it .
Out to lunch with the girls .
Give her a cold <unk> to suck on -- I gotta go -- there &apos;s a clean one in that bag -- I &apos;ll check back in a bit .
Sorry .
My kid -- Bullshit , you don &apos;t .
I don &apos;t wanna take your money , Mr. Masry .
All I have is hundreds .
Oh .
Okay .
That &apos;s okay .
Jane &apos;s the office manager .
She handles payroll and petty cash .
But she leaves early on Fridays .
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I &apos;d talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck ?
Just -- for the weekend .
I &apos;m &lt; u &gt; not &lt; / u &gt; everyone else , Mr. Masry .
I &apos;m someone you made promises to that you didn &apos;t deliver on .
I trusted you .
With my kids &apos; <unk> .
Now , I &apos;m smart , and I &apos;m <unk> working , and I &apos;ll do anything .
But if you think I &apos;m leaving here without a job , you got another thing coming .
Okay , look .
If you really want to apply for a job here , you can do it the way everyone else does .
Send in a <unk> <unk> sum <unk> , make an -- I don &apos;t need pity .
I need a paycheck .
And I &apos;ve looked , but when you &apos;ve spent the last six years raising babies , it &apos;s real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn .
So I figure , since you &apos;re the one who said I was gonna be okay , you should be the one to hire me .
I &apos;m sorry about that .
Really .
But -- You said things would be fine , and they &apos;re not .
I never lied .
I may have <unk> -- that happens sometimes , but -- There &apos;s two things I can &apos;t stand , Mr. Masry .
Being <unk> , and being lied to .
You did both .
You did ?
Wow , sorry about that .
Listen , <unk> &apos;s a little not so bright .
He seems to think that you said -- You never called me back .
I left <unk> .
Yeah ?
Well , fuck you .
Sorry doesn &apos;t feed my kids .
I &apos;m sorry , Erin .
&lt; u &gt; Settle down &lt; / u &gt; ?
I got <unk> bucks to my name , Mr. Masry !
I can &apos;t &lt; u &gt; afford &lt; / u &gt; to settle down !
Okay -- let &apos;s try and settle down here .
Bullshit .
You told me I &apos;d get half a million dollars .
You told me I &apos;d be set .
I told you the questions might get a little personal -- Oh , please , it was long over by then .
God damn , he made me look like some cheap -- If you hadn &apos;t used <unk> -- Open and shut ?
&lt; u &gt; Open and fucking shut &lt; / u &gt; ?
Yeah .
I know .
... just wanna be a good mom , a nice person , a decent citizen .
Just wanna take good care of my kids .
You know ?
... <unk> &apos;s six , Katie &apos;s four , and Beth &apos;s just nine months .
... couldn &apos;t take <unk> cause they made me too <unk> to take care of my kids .
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck .
I didn &apos;t have insurance , so I &apos;m about seventeen thousand in debt right now .
I think we should makes some changes .
I &apos;ve also been thinking about the team .
<unk> , who should cover what -- Who &apos;s the judge ?
<unk> .
We &apos;ve got good answers to all of &apos; em .
How many counts ?
When &apos;d they file the <unk> ?
At the time , I thought , I got six kids , some of &apos; em want to go to college .
I can &apos;t afford to lose my job .
I told myself I was being honorable .
But there &apos;s nothing honorable in what I did .
Maybe that &apos;s why they picked me for the job .
Maybe they knew what kind of man I was .
How come you didn &apos;t say anything when you found these things ?
Well .
There were a few documents that I somehow didn &apos;t get around to shredding .
That I kept instead .
What do you mean ?
Course as it turns out , I &apos;m not a very good employee .
And you were told to destroy those ?
There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation <unk> , the like .
But then there were a few <unk> about the holding ponds .
The water in them .
They had <unk> from test <unk> , stuff like that .
Well , it &apos;s pretty boring work , shredding -- you gotta find some way to <unk> your mind .
So yeah , I took a look .
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed ?
Nope .
And I didn &apos;t ask .
Did he say why ?
I was working in the <unk> , and out of nowhere the <unk> calls me up to the office and says , we &apos;re gonna give you a <unk> machine , and send you on down to the warehouse .
We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there .
The fuck you don &apos;t .
No one calls me <unk> .
That <unk> <unk> that called the other night could &apos;ve only found out about me from you .
People are dying , Ross .
You got document after document here , right under your nose , that says why , and you haven &apos;t said word one about it .
I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
Hey , Ross .
Tell me something .
Does PG &amp; E pay you to cover their ass , or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart ?
Ross -- you are an absolute angel .
You know what , Erin ?
I got nothing but time here .
Why don &apos;t you let me do that for you , and you can get your kids some dinner .
<unk> ?
That your middle name ?
Heck , yeah .
Come on back .
Just gonna need you to sign in here -- I wish I knew .
It &apos;s for my boss .
He &apos;s fighting his water bill , and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places .
The <unk> thing would probably be if I just <unk> back there with you and <unk> around myself .
Would that be okay ?
You just tell me what you want to look at and I &apos;ll be glad to dig &apos; em out for you .
I guess I did .
You come to the right place .
Well , believe it or not , I am on the <unk> for some water records .
Erin .
Cool .
What can I do for you , Erin ?
Ross .
Real pleased to meet you .
I &apos;m Erin .
Thank you very much .
Aren &apos;t you a gentleman ?
Mr. ... Oh , hey -- lemme give you a hand there .
Good luck .
Oh -- I wouldn &apos;t <unk> what you &apos;re looking for if I were you ... County water board .
All <unk> , thanks .
Every county has one .
They keep records of anything <unk> within their jurisdiction .
You should be able to find something there .
Hunh-uh .
What &apos;s that ?
Have you been to the water board ?
Well , how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley ?
Oh , yeah .
Definitely .
Highly toxic , highly <unk> .
Bad , bad stuff .
So that stuff -- it kills people .
With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God , anything , really -- <unk> disease , liver failure , heart failure , <unk> failure , chronic headaches , bone or organ <unk> -- plus , of course , any type of cancer .
<unk> , like -- how ?
What would you get ?
Yes .
There &apos;s <unk> chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body .
There &apos;s <unk> 3 , which is <unk> benign , and then there &apos;s <unk> 6 , hexavalent chromium , which , <unk> on the <unk> , can be very <unk> .
There &apos;s more than one kind ?
What kind of chromium is it ?
I don &apos;t know .
What are you &lt; u &gt; doing &lt; / u &gt; ?
Where &apos;s George ?
That &apos;s not true ; we had dinner together just last night .
It happens all the time .
Look , I know you &apos;re mad .
But the way this job is , things come up at the last minute , real important things , and I gotta deal with them .
Now I don &apos;t like me missing dinner any more than you do , but we &apos;re all gonna have to get used to it , cause the fact is , it &apos;s gonna happen sometimes .
Some kind of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , bimbo , I bet .
Yeah .
A real moron .
I &apos;m gonna hate it .
Oh , come on , where &apos;s your sense of adventure ?
We &apos;re going someplace you never been before .
I hate it too .
I hate this trip .
Sweetheart , you can get a whole big bunch .
Mommy , can I get a flower ?
How come you &apos;re not eating ?
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up .
Yeah , I &apos;m gonna start sleeping here .
Masry &amp; <unk> , can I -- damn it .
Does anyone know anything about these phones ?
Hey , <unk> .
Nice view , huh ?
In the conference -- Hey , <unk> , where are they ?
Yup .
They must be important , too , cause they came on a special plane .
PG &amp; -- Are you sure ?
Some meeting .
With PG &amp; E people .
What &apos;s going on in there ?
So did I.
Hey , Erin , I thought you were taking a sick day .
Hey , just so long as you see Him .
I &apos;m a slow reader , on account of the fact that I look at the word &quot; dog &quot; and see &quot; god &quot; .
You &apos;ve been reading for hours .
Hi , <unk> , this is Erin .
Brockovich .
From the file room ?
I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I &apos;m following up on that real estate thing out of the office .
Masry &amp; <unk> , can I help you ?
Cause her own mom &apos;s real sick , too .
How come her own mom isn &apos;t helping her ?
Yeah .
She is .
But you know what ?
That &apos;s why I &apos;m helping her .
So she can get some medicine to make her feel better .
She &apos;s one of the sick people ?
Oh , God , sweetheart , no .
There &apos;s nothing on Earth I love more than you .
Nothing .
I promise .
You never fall short for the work people .
I guess maybe you just love them more .
I never forget , honey .
I try , real hard .
It &apos;s just , for some reason , I don &apos;t seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys , I end up falling short .
You always say that .
Then you go to work and forget you promised .
We &apos;ll work out the <unk> hockey thing , okay ?
Whatever you want , we &apos;ll work it out .
I promise .
I &apos;m gonna go live with George .
God damn it , <unk> .
What the hell are you doing out here ?
Well , God damn it , <unk> -- Randy &apos;s mom doesn &apos;t work <unk> days , and Randy &apos;s dad didn &apos;t leave her , so figuring out who &apos;s gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy &apos;s house .
Randy &apos;s mom said yes right away .
Can I play <unk> hockey ?
Thank God we got you away from her , huh ?
Well I hate it .
There &apos;s no way a son of mine hates <unk> Town .
It &apos;s impossible .
That &apos;s all you got , lady .
Two wrong feet .
In fucking ugly shoes .
Okay , look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here -- <unk> Daniels .
<unk> .
You don &apos;t know six hundreds plaintiffs &apos; numbers by heart .
I said , &lt; u &gt; whose number do you need &lt; / u &gt; ?
Everyone &apos;s .
This is a lawsuit .
We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs .
Whose number do you need ?
Erin .
You don &apos;t even have phone numbers for some of them .
Don &apos;t talk to me like I &apos;m an idiot , okay ?
I may not have a law degree , but I &apos;ve spent 18 months on this case , and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will .
No offense .
There are just some things we need that you probably didn &apos;t know to ask .
Excuse me -- <unk> , was it ?
There are no holes in my research .
Yeah , we had them <unk> over .
And listen , good work .
They &apos;re a great start .
We &apos;re just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research .
Hey -- those are my files -- I will .
Bye .
Promise you &apos;ll turn around if you get tired .
We &apos;ll just be a minute .
Get a little more sleep .
No , I need my car -- Real early .
We &apos;re just gonna take your car to get some breakfast .
What time is it ?
Yeah , but I &apos;m gonna get better .
A lot of these folks aren &apos;t .
You shouldn &apos;t be driving around , you know .
You &apos;re sick .
You know me .
I pick things up real fast .
Think you could learn ?
Yeah , well -- good help is hard to find .
And I miss you .
I don &apos;t know .
Few days .
Thanks for helping me .
I appreciate it .
How long &apos;s this whole thing gonna take ?
Hunh-uh .
Not yet .
Look , don &apos;t take any of &apos; em on your bike , okay ?
Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere .
It &apos;s not for me ; it &apos;s for my kids .
You &apos;re the only one I trust them with .
I don &apos;t do favors for you anymore .
Hi .
It &apos;s me .
I got a favor to ask you .
Fine .
I &apos;ll drop &apos; em off tomorrow afternoon .
They said that &apos;d be tomorrow .
They just wanna keep an eye on me another night .
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be .
You already packed up your stuff ?
I need it .
More than you need me .
I can &apos;t .
Look -- this job -- it &apos;s the best thing that ever happened to me .
I mean it .
For the first time in my life , I got people <unk> me .
Up in Hinkley , I walk into a room and everyone <unk> up just to hear what I got to say .
I never had that .
Ever .
Don &apos;t ask me to give it up .
I need it .
Yeah , you can .
You could just quit .
People do it all the time .
I can &apos;t leave my job , George .
I know .
But still .
Six months .
I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend .
Cause there may be men who don &apos;t mind being the maid and getting nothing in return , but I &apos;m sure as shit not one of &apos; em .
I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m just working so hard -- It &apos;s a pair of earrings .
I saw &apos; em in the mall one day , and I thought , damn , those would look good on those beautiful <unk> .
So I bought &apos; em .
And I said to myself , next time Erin says something nice , does something nice , I &apos;ll surprise her with &apos; em .
Know how long ago that was ?
Six months .
In six months , you haven &apos;t said one nice thing to me .
That &apos;s a long time .
What &apos;s going on ?
What are you doing ?
<unk> &lt; u &gt; shit &lt; / u &gt; , Erin .
Bullshit .
That is not what I &apos;m -- Fuck you .
Just cause I don &apos;t spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am -- What do you want to talk about instead ?
&lt; u &gt; Your &lt; / u &gt; day ?
That &apos;s a fascinating subject .
It wouldn &apos;t kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while -- No , I wanna say hi .
Lock the door .
Cause it &apos;s my office party .
If you had an office , I &apos;d go to your party .
I &apos;m just saying -- we have one night to ourselves , why do we have to spend it here ?
Just a few more minutes , then we can go .
Take her , will you ?
I &apos;m bored , and so are the kids .
Yeah .
We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said , &quot; ball . &quot;
What ?
Beth ?
My Beth ?
Well , come to think of it , we did have a big event around here .
Beth started talking .
No , no jokes , I gotta pee .
Just tell me about your day .
What went on back there ?
What do you want , a joke ?
I &apos;m so tired I &apos;m about to drive off the road .
Keep me awake , willya ?
I know what they can sleep through , Erin .
I probably know it better than you .
Keep your voice down .
Cause I can get a job .
I will .
And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again .
Would that make you happy ?
I didn &apos;t say that .
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job , just say so .
You mind telling me what that &apos;s supposed to mean ?
How would you know ?
It doesn &apos;t have to be this complicated , Erin .
There &apos;s a lot of jobs out there .
No , see -- that &apos;s exactly what those arrogant PG &amp; E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power , we don &apos;t stand a chance in hell against them .
But you know what ?
They &apos;re wrong .
Look , don &apos;t take this the wrong way , but don &apos;t you think you might be out of your league here ?
I &apos;m not in danger .
I have a dead bolt .
Remember ?
Come on , Erin .
A job &apos;s supposed to pay your bills , not put you in danger .
I &apos;m not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call , George .
I know what you &apos;re saying , and I don &apos;t wanna hear it .
I am doing the best I can .
I &apos;m just saying -- Well , hell , I guess that &apos;s it , then , huh ?
They &apos;re scarred for life .
They &apos;re gonna start holding up <unk> &apos;s any day now .
One toy per kid is doing something nice .
Four is ... something else .
George , I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off .
Could you please not give me a hard time about it ?
You &apos;re someone to me .
You &apos;re someone real special to me .
No I &apos;m not .
Look at me .
I &apos;m not .
You are someone .
Well , I &apos;m sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be .
I was supposed to have one of those great lives , with everything all <unk> out and perfect .
I mean , hell -- I was Miss <unk> , for God &apos;s sakes .
Did I tell you that ?
You live next door to a real live beauty queen .
I still got the <unk> .
I kept it cause I thought it meant something .
I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life .
I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone .
You &apos;re not nothing , Erin .
Doesn &apos;t matter .
Doesn &apos;t make one bit of difference .
Oh God , George , how &apos;d this happen to me ?
How &apos;d I end up so ... so &lt; u &gt; nothing &lt; / u &gt; ?
What ?
But you been working so hard -- I &lt; u &gt; can &apos;t &lt; / u &gt; call an <unk> .
I can &apos;t afford one .
God , I can &apos;t even afford my &lt; u &gt; phone &lt; / u &gt; .
I got fired .
It &apos;s a simple thing .
Everybody gets them .
All we gotta do is call an <unk> .
What kind of person lives like this ?
Huh ?
What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of <unk> ?
I &apos;m gonna clean it up .
<unk> a leak under your sink .
What are you doing here ?
What do you mean ?
You think it could make you sick , living in a place like this ?
I guess we get what we pay for , huh ?
Thanks for <unk> me .
I &apos;m gonna put a dead bolt on your front door , too .
This isn &apos;t exactly the safest neighborhood in the world , you know .
Better safe than sorry .
What &apos;re you doing ?
Yeah , we &apos;ll just see about that , won &apos;t we ?
This isn &apos;t gonna get you laid , you know .
Yup .
Usually working on my bike .
No big deal .
If it doesn &apos;t work out , you can send &apos; em back to the chicken fat lady .
You &apos;re around every afternoon ?
Cause I like kids .
I like hanging out with them .
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids ?
Then lemme remind you , the polite thing is to say , thank you , that &apos;s a real nice offer , I don &apos;t mind taking you up on it .
It &apos;s been a while .
Maybe I &apos;m just out of practice .
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you ?
I hope that &apos;s not supposed to impress me .
I do construction , which pays real good .
And I make it last by living cheap .
Yeah ?
And what do you do the rest of the time , live off your trust fund ?
I &apos;m not a deadbeat .
I work when I need to .
Great .
Another deadbeat .
I was serious before , you know .
If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don &apos;t have a job now , so I &apos;m around in the <unk> .
I &apos;m never here .
I gotta leave &apos; em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat .
Yeah .
I &apos;m probably ruining them .
Yeah , and whose fault is that ?
Cause I don &apos;t even know you .
I &apos;m not gonna leave my kids with you .
You need help with your kids ?
I could probably do that .
I had a good neighbor , George .
She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free .
Something tells me you &apos;re not gonna be able to measure up to that .
Return &apos; em .
Maybe you &apos;ll get your money back .
C &apos;mon .
I bought &apos; em for you , to make up for that night .
Yeah .
<unk> , huh ?
And here &apos;s another : five .
That &apos;s how old my other daughter is .
Seven is my son &apos;s age .
Two is how many times I been married and divorced .
You getting all this ?
16 is the number of dollars in my bank account .
<unk> is my phone number .
And with all the other numbers I gave you , I &apos;m <unk> zero is the number of times you &apos;re gonna call it .
You got a little girl ?
Sure .
That &apos;s one of my numbers .
It &apos;s how many months old my little girl is .
Shit , yeah .
I got numbers coming out of my ears .
Like , for instance , ten .
You got more than one ?
Which number do you want , George ?
You want my number ?
Now , don &apos;t be like that .
Tell you what .
How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my <unk> ?
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet , and we &apos;ll get along fine .
Ooh , now , see , if I <unk> known there was a beautiful woman next door , I <unk> done this different .
Let &apos;s start over .
My name &apos;s George .
What &apos;s yours ?
Well , I &apos;m the neighbors .
There , now we &apos;re introduced , so you can shut the fuck up .
Just <unk> myself to the neighbors .
What the hell do you think you &apos;re doing , making all that Goddamn noise ?
Well , hello to you , darlin &apos; .
A lot .
But you hang in there , maybe you &apos;ll get one .
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car , it &apos;d mean everything else was fine .
I don &apos;t even know how much they cost .
Jaguar &apos;s a darn pretty car .
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life , Erin ?
A Jaguar .
I &apos;m real sorry , Laura .
It &apos;s just -- the pain .
It &apos;s only getting worse .
I can &apos;t be a good wife .
I can &apos;t be a good mother .
That &apos;s okay .
I understand .
You &apos;re clever .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll think of something .
Now how &apos;m I supposed to do that when I &apos;m not in here most mornings and nights ?
I moved payroll onto the computer .
It only knows to process <unk> for employees who log on in the morning and off at night .
Have you been <unk> on ?
Where &apos;s my paycheck ?
I am not talking to you , bitch .
Yes .
It &apos;s called <unk> .
What am I supposed to do , check in every two seconds ?
There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time , but this isn &apos;t one of them .
Here , if you don &apos;t do the work , you don &apos;t get to stay .
What &apos;s going on ?
-- toothbrush , <unk> , and a pair of hose .
Here .
I had photos of my kids , plus a mug -- Nice to see you , Erin .
We &apos;ve missed you .
Someone stole my stuff .
What do I look like , Erin ?
A library ?
I mean , it &apos;s not a problem or anything , but -- I &apos;m just a little <unk> on what those things are .
I thought maybe you &apos;d know .
Well , this old neighbor of mine , Bob <unk> -- he ran the <unk> on <unk> -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other .
I just figured it was something in the genes .
And you know how it is -- you don &apos;t like to ask about things like that ... You know that thing it says in here about <unk> ?
I &apos;m surprised Donna didn &apos;t say anything .
I know .
It &apos;s an awful lot .
There &apos;s something else , too .
It sure could , yeah .
Thanks a lot .
When Donna told us about you , and what you told her about the chromium , we figured that might have something to do with this , too .
Yeah .
Who are you ?
Excuse me , are you Erin Brockovich ?
I know .
But it &apos;s good for me .
Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids .
And it &apos;s good for you , too .
Now you have money , you can find a good <unk> , huh ?
Not the old lady next door .
Wow , that &apos;s soon -- You &apos;re moving away ?
When ?
My daughter , she &apos;s bought a big house with a room for me .
I &apos;m going to move in with her .
<unk> , <unk> .
Because I didn &apos;t want to tell you before , with your worries -- It &apos;ll be fine , yeah .
Outside with the <unk> .
So it &apos;s good ?
Hi , sweetie .
Were you a good girl ?
Where are <unk> and Katie ?
Don &apos;t go telling anyone .
It &apos;ll ruin my reputation .
I gotta say , Erin -- first time I saw you , I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own <unk> study .
Well , if you &apos;re talking about <unk> , you &apos;re getting out of my area of expertise .
Let me give you the name of a <unk> friend of mine over at USC .
Uh-huh .
<unk> the last few days knocking on doors .
And you know what ?
They &apos;re not .
I mean , they got problems , but none of this cancer stuff .
And their pets are fine .
So I don &apos;t know -- I just can &apos;t shake the feeling that it wasn &apos;t no <unk> they put in the water .
... and when I realized our area &apos;s just as bad as Hinkley , I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too .
So I went and asked .
Well , from what this stuff says , I &apos;d say they both have some form of cancer .
Their parents , I &apos;m pretty sure .
They &apos;ve both got some immune system problem .
Can &apos;t say what from , whether it &apos;s <unk> or genetic or what , but something &apos;s wrong .
And these guys -- Donna and Peter -- Right , I guess those are the kids -- Well , look , there isn &apos;t a ton of information here , but from what there is , I &apos;d say that these two people here -- what are their names ?
<unk> and <unk> ?
Of course !
Oh , gosh , of course -- No one put me up to anything .
I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions .
He did , didn &apos;t he ?
&lt; u &gt; Baxter &lt; / u &gt; !
Is this a joke ?
Did Baxter put you up to this ?
Hi , I &apos;m Erin Brockovich .
I was just over in the library there , asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it <unk> ?
-- and the fella there told me to find you , cause you know all about it .
And code the signal to my private chamber .
Yes , My Lord .
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission .
Yes , he <unk> you make contact with him ....
It was .... the Emperor ....
Yes , My Lord .
We &apos;ll find them .
Alert all <unk> .
<unk> every possible <unk> along their last known <unk> and <unk> the fleet to search for them .
Don &apos;t fail me again , Admiral , I &apos;ve had quite enough !
Lord Vader , our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing .
The Millennium Falcon definitely went into <unk> .
It &apos;s probably on the other side of the galaxy by now .
Yes , Admiral .... soon .
Soon , Lord Vader .
<unk> don &apos;t concern me , Admiral .
I want that ship , not excuses .
How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me ?
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon , My Lord .
It has entered an asteroid field .
Come in , Admiral .
No ... there is another .
The boy is our last hope .
Told you , I did .
Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse .
Strong is Vader .
<unk> is your fate .
Mind what you have learned ... <unk> everything , everything !
It can save you .
Luke , use The Force only for knowledge and for defense , not as a weapon .
Don &apos;t give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke <unk> and <unk> back into his ship .
You are the last Jedi , Luke .
You are our only hope .
Be patient .
<unk> they must be .
Do you hear ?
On this all depends .
We &apos;ve come this far ...
He is our only hope .
Will he finish what he begins ?
He &apos;s too old .
Yes .
Too old to start the training .
This one I have watched a long time .
All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon , to the sky , to the future .
Never his mind on where he was , on what he was doing .
Adventure , excitement ... A Jedi <unk> not these things !
He can do it .
We &apos;ve discussed this before .
Much anger in him , like in his father .
He will learn patience .
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight , with The Force as his ally , will conquer Vader and his Emperor .
If you end your training now , if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be <unk> deeper into the <unk> of hate , despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now .
Luke , I will not lose you to the Emperor , as I lost Vader .
And that is why I must go .
Will you ?
You underestimate The Emperor .
It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer .
But you cannot control it .
This is a dangerous time for you , Luke .
You are now most <unk> to the temptations of the dark side .
I feel The Force .
You &apos;re not ready yet .
You still have much to learn .
I can help them !
You don &apos;t know that .
Even I cannot see their fate .
But Han and Leia will surely die .
... Luke , you must not go .
Luke ... you are the only hope .
Ben ... Ben ... You must go to the <unk> System ...
There you will learn from one who taught me : Yoda , the Jedi Master .
I &apos;m cold ... so cold ... You must survive , Luke .
You must .
Luke , look at me !
I can &apos;t ... We &apos;re not out of this yet .
Turns on Lando , the <unk> , with an <unk> <unk> .
Barks an argument and shakes his head .
Three patrol ships are heading our way .
What &apos;s wrong with him ?
Barks a blue streak .
Everyone &apos;s invited , of course .
Barks at the mention of food .
<unk> his lips .
<unk> a <unk> <unk> .
How you doing , <unk> ?
Still wasting your time with this clown , eh ?
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll see you again , too .
Keep well .
You &apos;d better chain him until it &apos;s over .
Barks a <unk> farewell .
No , I &apos;m alright .
I &apos;m alright .
Barks his concern .
Not now , Chewie .
Lando , aren &apos;t you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down ?
Barks at Han .
Why don &apos;t we just turn him over to Lando to fix ?
<unk> and <unk> his shoulders .
That was a long time ago .
I &apos;m sure he &apos;s forgotten all about it , and so should you .
Barks and <unk> at his boss .
Well , it &apos;s been awhile .
Barks his agreement .
Okay , Chewie , it &apos;s now or never .
Chewie , head for the bottom of the city .
Barks his <unk> .
... the power ?
Barks his <unk> right on ! <unk> I don &apos;t care .
It would &apos;ve been worth it .... for Han .
Barks his agreement .
We should have stayed and finished them off .
Barks at his master .
How could you know my father ?
You don &apos;t even know who I am .
Can &apos;t we get on with this already ?
Oh , your father ... a powerful Jedi was he , powerful Jedi .
Because of my father , I guess .
Not far , not far .
Be patient .
Soon you will see him .
Why wish you become a Jedi ?
Will it take long to get there ?
How far away is he ?
It &apos;s the Jedi &apos;s time to eat , too .
Look , it smells good .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s delicious But I don &apos;t know why we can &apos;t see Yoda now .
<unk> .
It &apos;s time to eat .
...
I told you , I &apos;m not hungry .
Of course , yes .
But now eat we must .
Good food , I have good food .
Come , come .
You know the Jedi Master ?
Oh , a Jedi Master .
Different <unk> .
Yoda you seek , Yoda .
I &apos;m not looking for a friend .
I &apos;m looking for a Jedi Master .
No , no !
I &apos;ll stay and help you find your friend .
Okay , Artoo , let him have it .
Now get out of here , little fellow , we &apos;ve got things to do .
<unk> ?
<unk> ?
My home this is .
I don &apos;t want your help .
I want my lamp back .
I &apos;ll need it in this slimy <unk> .
Mine !
Mine !
Or I &apos;ll help you not .
Give me that !
Can &apos;t get your ship out ?
Have you tried ?
Have you tried ?
Listen , friend , we didn &apos;t mean to land here , and if I could get my fighter out of this <unk> I would , but I can &apos;t .
So ... A great warrior ?
Not many on those .
Wars don &apos;t make one great .
I &apos;m looking for a great warrior .
Help you I can ... yes ... yes .
Looking ?
Looking ?
You &apos;ve found someone I &apos;d say .
Heh ?
Yes !
I &apos;m looking for someone .
Away put your weapon .
I mean you no harm .
... Like we &apos;re being watched .
Then I &apos;ll see you in Hell .
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker .
You bet it is ... and Luke &apos;s out in it .
The temperature is dropping too fast .
We &apos;ll have to go out on <unk> .
We haven &apos;t got them <unk> to this cold yet ... Not likely !
Where are the <unk> ?
Commander Skywalker hasn &apos;t come through the south entrance , sir .
Maybe he slipped by without checking in .
Probably isn &apos;t good enough , Sergeant .
Check on it !
I haven &apos;t seen him .
He probably came in through the south entrance .
Sergeant , is Commander Skywalker back yet ?
He will join us or die , My Master .
Yes ... yes .
That would be a great asset .
But , if he could be turned , he would be a powerful ally .
You are weak !
I have seen it .
The Force is strong with him .
He must be destroyed .
He &apos;s not a Jedi , he &apos;s just a boy .
Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
The son of Skywalker .
You must destroy him ... or he will be our <unk> .
Our destruction ?
Who ?
Our situation is most <unk> .
We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction .
I have felt it .
There is a grave disturbance in The Force .
What is thy bidding , My Master ?
Fine .
But they &apos;ll have to take care of themselves .
Wait .
I &apos;ll send a patrol with you .
Whatever it is , it isn &apos;t friendly .
I &apos;m going to have a look .
Come on , Chewie .
I understand .
A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again , may the force be with you .
Thank you , General .
But there &apos;s a price on my head .
If I don &apos;t pay off Jabba the <unk> , I &apos;m a walking dead man .
You &apos;re an extraordinary fighter .
I hate to lose you .
The Empire won &apos;t look for you out here .
I &apos;d say you &apos;re all set ... which means it &apos;s time for me to get going .
With all the <unk> activity in this system , it &apos;s going to be difficult to spot approaching ships .
He &apos;s checking out a <unk> that hit near him .
He &apos;ll be in soon .
Good , and Commander Skywalker ?
There isn &apos;t a hint of life in the area .
But all the perimeter markers are set , so you &apos;ll know if anyone comes calling .
Captain Solo .
What &apos;s the situation ?
Good .
Soon as we &apos;re clear , we &apos;ll kick this baby into <unk> .
I can see the edge of the asteroid field , sir .
Not collapsing , honey .
It &apos;s closing !
This is no cave ... We &apos;re <unk> .
Goodbye , <unk> Leia .
Goodbye , Captain ...
I &apos;m going to see what it is .
It sounds like it &apos;s trying to get in .
I must admit there are times I don &apos;t understand human behavior .
You , too , golden rod .
Sir , I &apos;m almost afraid to ask , but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me ?
What are you so <unk> about ?
We &apos;re in trouble !
If I may say so , Sir , I noticed earlier that the entire main <unk> light system seems to be damaged .
I think we &apos;re in trouble .
It can wait .
Sit down , and shut up !
Sir , I was wondering ...
The energy shield is down .
We &apos;ll be stuck here forever .
<unk> <unk> .
get out of here .
Go !
The kid ran into something mean , and it wasn &apos;t the cold .
I do hope he &apos;s all there ... if you take my meaning .
I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
He doesn &apos;t make sense to me either , Chewie .
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon .
I don &apos;t know , Artoo .
Sir , might I <unk> what &apos;s going on ?
She is looking for Master Luke , and assumed he would be here with you .
No one seems to know ...
I shut it off .
What &apos;s her royal <unk> want ?
<unk> Leia has been trying to reach you on the <unk> , but either you have it turned off , or it is <unk> ... if it &apos;s damaged , Artoo , could fix it , if you like .
What is it ?
Captain Solo , sir .
Might I have a word with you ?
... just remember that , <unk> cause I &apos;ll be back ... ...
I love you .
I couldn &apos;t tell you before , but it &apos;s true .
Me either .
They had me howling on the scan grid , but they never asked me any questions .
I &apos;m worried about all of us .
I can &apos;t figure out what they &apos;re up to .
I was worried about you .
Look , sweetheart , I &apos;m not going to have you accusing my friend of ... Chewie , do you think you can repair him ?
Well , I do trust him .
Lando &apos;s an old friend .
Must have been an accident .
Something &apos;s wrong here .
Your friend Lando is very charming , but I don &apos;t trust him .
He found him in a junk pile ... Luke !
I &apos;m sure he &apos;s fine .
Probably sitting around wondering what we &apos;re doing right now .
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right .
Huh ?
Oh .
Your <unk> &apos;s been gone too long just to be lost .
He may have gotten into some trouble .
Chewie went to look for him .
Come over here .
I want to check this out .
Has <unk> turned up yet ?
You look great .
You look silly .
What are you staring at ?
It &apos;ll be all right .
Trust me .
And keep your eyes open .
You wait here .
I don &apos;t like this .
Let <unk> er go , Chewie .
You do have your moments ... Not many , but you do have them .
No .
But he has no love for the Empire , that much I know ... Can you trust him ?
A <unk> gas mine .
Lando won it in a <unk> match , or so he claims .
Lando and I go way back .
A mining colony .
Lando &apos;s not a system , he &apos;s a man .
A <unk> , <unk> ... all- around scoundrel ... ... your kind of guy .
The system is called <unk> .
It &apos;s a ways from here , but <unk> .
Never heard of that system .
Well , sometimes ... <unk> , I knew it !
Lando Calrissian .
You keep logs ?
My , how organized .
Funny , I have the feeling I &apos;ve been in this area before .
Let me check my logs .
Here ... near the <unk> system .
That depends .
Where are we ?
Then we have to find a safe <unk> around here .
Got any ideas ?
Not bad , hot shot , not bad .
Then what ?
The fleet is finally breaking up .
I &apos;m hoping they &apos;ll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed .
What &apos;d you have in mind for your next move ?
Chewie , check the manual release on the landing claws .
I &apos;m still not sure what you &apos;ve accomplished .
Oh , so sorry !
Didn &apos;t mean to offend your <unk> .
You think <unk> and shutting down in that amount of time is easy ?
You could have warned him before you shut him off .
You &apos;re going to attack them ? ! ! !
Sharp bank , Chewie .
Let &apos;s turn this bucket around .
You heard me , turn around !
Full power on the front shield .
It &apos;s not my fault .
I can &apos;t under- stand it !
Couldn &apos;t be , I checked the transfer circuits , just like you said !
I tell you this time it &apos;s not my fault .
I &apos;m sure I checked it .
The entrance is collapsing !
I see it Chewie , hang on .
But the <unk> have stopped .
<unk> yourself in , sweetheart , we &apos;re taking off !
Those Star <unk> will spot us long before you can get into light speed .
You can &apos;t make the jump in this asteroid field .
There will be more of them .
They always travel in groups .
And there &apos;s nothing they like better than to <unk> themselves to ships .
Just what we need right now .
Looks like some kind of <unk> .
Look , we just got this bucket going again .
I &apos;m not about to let some <unk> tear it apart ... Are you crazy !
Outside , in the cave .
There &apos;s something out there !
Try and control this ...
I do not !
You mean a man you can control .
There &apos;s nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized .
Sure , they &apos;re safer .
You always know what they &apos;re going to do .
Trouble is , it gets a little dull .
Don &apos;t count on it .
I happen to like nice men .
Afraid of ?
Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy .
What are you afraid of ?
That &apos;s quite a compliment .
Sometimes , maybe ... occasionally , when you aren &apos;t acting like a scoundrel .
You could be a touch <unk> , though .
Admit it , against your better judgment you think I &apos;m all right .
Yes , you do .
Sure .
I guess I make it difficult sometimes .
Would you please stop calling me that ?
Easy , your worship .
Only trying to help .
Where have I heard that before ?
They &apos;re just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we &apos;re safe .
They &apos;re moving away .
Felt like a <unk> <unk> ... an Imperial <unk> .
That was no earthquake .
Fine with me .
But I &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll have to let go .
I don &apos;t expect anything , except to be left alone .
Well , I hope you don &apos;t expect more .
Sorry , Captain , being held by you isn &apos;t enough to get me excited .
How do I look ?
You don &apos;t look angry .
Very funny .
You can let go now ....
I &apos;m getting angry .
Why , Princess , this is so sudden .
That should do nicely .
What is it ?
There , there .
Chewie get a reading on that .
Looks pretty good .
Right .
I &apos;m going to get in closer to one of these big ones ... Now you &apos;re making sense .
We &apos;ve got to get out of this shower .
I &apos;m against that .
But we &apos;re going to get <unk> if we stay out here much longer .
That Star <unk> is <unk> down .
I take it back .
Well , you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong .
Aren &apos;t I ?
Hang on , sweetheart .
We &apos;re gonna do some flyin &apos; .
To get killed ... you &apos;re not seriously going into an asteroid field ?
Let &apos;s hope so ... it &apos;s just the chance we need .
Probably an asteroid field .... <unk> !
Chewie , bank left , let &apos;s find out where they &apos;re coming from ... Or you ran into something .... That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
I &apos;m glad you said there was going to be no problem , or I &apos;d be worried .
Two more Star <unk> heading right at us .
I know , I know , I see them ... <unk> See what ?
I &apos;ll be surprised if we ever start moving .
This baby &apos;s got a few surprises left in her .
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that <unk> .
Don &apos;t worry , your <unk> , I &apos;ll get her started .
Would it help if I got out and pushed ?
Wait , don &apos;t open it ... that &apos;s one of the traps for the ice creatures .
Hey !
Someone &apos;s still in here .
Who &apos;s <unk> ?
I tell ya &apos; sweetheart , I must &apos;ve hit pretty close to the mark to get you <unk> &apos; like this .
Doesn &apos;t it look that way to you , Luke ?
Why you <unk> , <unk> , half- <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Come on , your highness , are you telling me you haven &apos;t been thinking about that kiss ?
You must have gone completely out of your <unk> mind .
Ooops !
I guess you haven &apos;t told Luke about that yet .
I don &apos;t know what he &apos;s talking about .
I had nothing to do with it .
General <unk> thinks it &apos;s dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from .
Well , your worship , it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer .
Now don &apos;t panic .
We don &apos;t know that .
An Imperial probe <unk> .
<unk> of some kind .
I didn &apos;t hit it that hard .
It must have had a <unk> .... What was it ?
....
I &apos;m afraid there &apos;s not much left .
No kidding .
If this <unk> &apos;s got nasty natives , they could be anywhere .
Now all we &apos;ve got to worry about is what attacked him .
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we &apos;d better double the security ... Han , I don &apos;t know how ... Sure ...
If I were interested .
But I don &apos;t think it &apos;d be much fun .
And you think you &apos;re the one to apply some heat ?
Spare me please !
Don &apos;t tell me about the <unk> again .
I &apos;ve had it with your noble mission .
All you let yourself think about is the <unk> .
The result is you &apos;re as cold as this planet .
We are fighting for a cause much ...
There &apos;s no <unk> for taste .
Believe me , you could use a good kiss .
You &apos;ve spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you &apos;ve never learned how to be a woman .
It &apos;s a shame , because you &apos;ve got all the <unk> for one .
I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you &apos;d have let go for a minute .
But it &apos;s too late now , sweetheart .
Your big opportunity is flying out of here .
I &apos;d just as soon kiss a <unk> .
Am I ?
I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss .
I respect you .
You &apos;re a bold fighter , maybe not the brightest , but ... <unk> No , your worship .. That &apos;s not what I &apos;m talking about .
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me .
And what are they , pray tell ?
You probably don &apos;t .
How could you ?
You &apos;re so terrified of your own emotions ... Me ?
I don &apos;t know what you mean .
Han , we need you here .
He &apos;ll know when he gets back ... Don &apos;t give me that look .
Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me .
If I don &apos;t pay off Jabba soon , there &apos;ll be too many to stop ... <unk> , <unk> killers , and who knows what else .
I &apos;ve got to get that price off my head while I still have a head .
Does Luke know ?
That bounty hunter we ran into on <unk> <unk> changed my mind .
You said you were going to stay .
What happened ?
Yes , Your Highness ?
Don &apos;t worry .
You haven &apos;t seen the last of us .
I hope you make your peace with Jabba .
Now don &apos;t get the wrong idea , pal .
She was just trying to express her true feelings for me .
That makes a good story .
But I think you just can &apos;t bear to let me out of your sight .
<unk> ?
What probe ?
That &apos;s two you owe me , junior .
Thanks to you .
Hi kid , you look strong enough to wrestle a <unk> .
I &apos;ll see you shortly .
A <unk> just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won &apos;t be long .
There isn &apos;t enough life on this ice <unk> to fill a space cruiser .
My <unk> markers are placed .
I &apos;m heading back to the base .
I &apos;ve finished my circle and I haven &apos;t picked up any life <unk> <unk> .
<unk> and clear , kid .
What &apos;s up ?
Yeah , you &apos;re a real hero .
Don &apos;t shoot !
I &apos;ve done what I can for you .
I &apos;m sorry it &apos;s not better , but I &apos;ve got my own problems .
I &apos;ve already stuck my neck out further than I should ... Don &apos;t ask me , but he &apos;s on his way .
All this just to get the kid ?
What &apos;s so important about him ?
Luke ?
I don &apos;t get it .
He doesn &apos;t want you at all .
He &apos;s after someone named Skywalker .
You don &apos;t know much about much if you think Vader won &apos;t want us dead before this is over .
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me .
They &apos;ll have to stay here , but at least they &apos;ll be safe .
This ought to be good .
Shut up a minute and listen .
I &apos;m doing what I can to make this easier for you .
Get out of here , Lando !
I &apos;m sorry too .
Sorry friend , I had no choice .
They arrived right before you did .
Nothing .
I never would have guessed that underneath that wild <unk> I knew was a <unk> <unk> leader and businessman ...
But you wear it well .
Not as well as I &apos;d like .
We &apos;re a small <unk> and not very self- <unk> .
I &apos;ve had supply problems of every kind and ... What &apos;s so funny ?
How &apos;s your mining operation going ?
I &apos;ll have my people get to work on it right away .
Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart .
That ship saved my life a few times .
It &apos;s the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the galaxy .
What &apos;s wrong with her ?
What have you done to my ship ?
That won &apos;t be easy , my friend ... What brings you here , anyway ?
I always said you were a gentleman .
Are you kidding ?
No hard feelings ?
Why you slimy , <unk> <unk> <unk> ... am I glad to see you .
I &apos;m <unk> the bargain .
<unk> I don &apos;t alter it any further .
That wasn &apos;t the bargain .
You said the Empire wouldn &apos;t interfere in-- Take them , but I &apos;m keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them .
I &apos;ll take what &apos;s mine now .
I think not .
But I don &apos;t wish my prize to be damaged .
We &apos;ll test it first .
Bring in Captain Solo .
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing .
If you put him in there , it &apos;ll kill him .
Good .
It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent <unk> here .
I forget nothing , Calrissian .
Perhaps you think you &apos;re being treated <unk> .
That was never mentioned .
Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han .
I hope you haven &apos;t forgotten our bargain .
You will find them well enough .
But they must never again leave this city .
What about Leia and the <unk> ?
That sounds familiar .
I &apos;m sure my men fixed it .
We &apos;ve got nothing to worry about .
Are the <unk> set ?
The <unk> shields are gone .
It &apos;s Luke .
Get under him .
Slow down .
Easy Chewie .
Line up your tracking system .
Lando , open the hatch .
Wait a minute .
We &apos;re not going back there .
No argument , just do it .
That &apos;s a command !
Luke needs help .
We must go back .
I knew that set-up was too good to last ....
I &apos;m going to miss it .
I didn &apos;t say anything ?
What &apos;d you say ?
His fate is sealed .
You &apos;ll be lucky to get out yourself .
All systems are on alert .
everything &apos;s locked .
We &apos;ve got to find Luke .
Don &apos;t worry about a thing .
I &apos;ll get us going .
You &apos;d better know what you &apos;re doing , or this is going to get very messy .
What chance have we got in here ?
What are we going to do when they cut ... Sure I did ... once .
It turned out lousy .
You &apos;ve probably never done an honorable thing in your life .
Very noble .
Not smart , but noble .
There &apos;s not much chance , but the bounty hunter &apos;s ship is on the East <unk> <unk> .
Chewie &apos;s right .
We must try to save Han .
This is no time to be <unk> , honey .
What do you say we debate this later ?
There &apos;s still a chance I can get you out of here .
We have no use for your kind .
Look , I stand to lose everything by this .
And when do you betray us again ?
I &apos;m coming over to your side , that &apos;s what .
And I have a feeling I &apos;m making a big mistake .
What &apos;s going on ?
... we &apos;re the bait .
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
I didn &apos;t know you had a price on your head .
Vader has given you to the bounty hunter .
What about Han ?
Yes , we keep <unk> down by having the power <unk> far below the city .
It &apos;s connected by a transfer shaft .
It &apos;s a lovely <unk> .
Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed , so you might say we &apos;re <unk> .
Most of our trade is , well ... <unk> .
You &apos;re part of the mining <unk> then ?
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire .
Would you care to join me for a little <unk> ?
I must say , your beauty is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you belong here with us among the clouds .
Sorry , am I interrupting anything ?
You may call me Leia .
Hello !
What have we here ?
Welcome , I am Baron Lando Calrissian , <unk> of this facility ... and who might you be ?
We have no choice .
Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out .
Two <unk> at a time is awfully risky .
What is it ?
We &apos;ve picked up something outside the base in zone one , moving East .
Not yet .
They &apos;re working on it now .
Have they analyzed the one that was killed ?
<unk> , but yes , there &apos;s a chance .
They have a shelter .
It &apos;s not much , but ... Is there any chance of them <unk> out there ?
The <unk> should be ready in the morning .
They &apos;ll make the search easier .
Nothing more can be done tonight .
The shield doors must be closed .
I can &apos;t wait any longer .
I &apos;m sorry .
Artoo , you did it !
I never <unk> you for a second ...
I thought you knew this person .
Rather touchy , aren &apos;t they .
Well , what now ?
Sir , we &apos;ve lost the rear <unk> shield .
One more direct hit on the back quarter and we &apos;re done for .
Oh my , no !
Sir , it &apos;s very possible this asteroid is not stable .
If I might remind you , sir , the probability of successfully <unk> <unk> through an asteroid field is <unk> <unk> to one ... a <unk> surrender might not be ... You don &apos;t have to do this to impress me .
I &apos;ll be back later .
So much has happened during the period of your <unk> , sir .
You rest now .
I &apos;ve never seen it fail .
This <unk> had better work .
Lando , is he alright ?
... Lando ?
Are you there ?
How &apos;s Luke ?
Luke , no !
It &apos;s a trap .
Snow creatures ... they &apos;re here ? !
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and <unk> some of those snow creatures .
Jabba the <unk> ?
He wants to pay off that criminal he &apos;s in hock to .
Calm down , will ya ?
Tell me about Han .
First Han , now you .
When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself ?
... What are you talking about ?
That &apos;s just great .
Why doesn &apos;t everyone just take off ?
I have this ... feeling .
I &apos;m not sure , really ... Where are you going ?
What did you say ? !
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while ?
Me too .
I was afraid .
I &apos;m fine .
Really .
Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well , it made me think about things .
The <unk> are growing well .
The scars should be gone in a day or so .
Does it still hurt ?
If it must be .
Yes .
And sacrifice Han and Leia ?
I &apos;ve learned so much since then .
And I &apos;ll return to finish ...
I promise that , master .
Yes , yes .
To Obi-wan you listen young one .
The tree .
Remember your failure at the tree !
Heh ?
<unk> is helpful , but painful sometimes and dangerous too .
You have far to go in your training .
They &apos;re my friends .
<unk> to see .
Always in motion is the future ... Back away , little machine !
Will they die ?
It is the future you see .
I see them !
...
They &apos;re in pain ... they &apos;re suffering .
<unk> .
I see it too ... Friends you have there , heh ?
Concentrate and see them you will .
I see a city in the clouds .
Control , control you must learn of what you see .
Not easy , not fast .
My mind <unk> with so many images .
Free your mind and return he will .
Only what you take with you .
What &apos;s in there ?
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force .
A servant of evil it is .
Into it you must go .
I feel cold .
Yes ...
I also feel danger ... death .
Something &apos;s not right .
Four this time !
The Force you feel .
No !
Nothing more will I tell you now .
Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
But tell me why ... You will know .
When you are at peace ... calm ... <unk> .
A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense .
Never for attack .
But how am I to know the good side from the dark ?
No , no .
<unk> , quicker , more <unk> .
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger ?
The dark side <unk> .
But if once start down the dark path , forever will it <unk> your destiny .
<unk> you it will ... as it did Obi-wan &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> ?
What do you mean ?
Anger , fear , aggression !
The dark side of The Force are they .
<unk> they flow ... quick to join you in a fight .
<unk> , beware , beware of them .
A heavy price is paid for the power they bring .
But I feel The Force flowing !
No , no .
This will not do .
Anger is what you feel .
That would matter not were The Force flowing through you .
<unk> you &apos;d jump !
Faster you &apos;d move !
Open yourself to The Force you must .
They &apos;re a lot stronger than I &apos;m used to .
That they are .
I thought those <unk> were set for <unk> !
<unk> .
Heh ?
<unk> .
That is why you fail .
I don &apos;t believe it .
<unk> has no meaning .
It matters not .
Look at me .
Judge me by my size do you ?
I can &apos;t .
It &apos;s too big .
No .
Try not .
Do , do .
Or do not .
There is no try .
Okay .
I &apos;ll give it a try .
No !
No different !
The differences are in your mind .
Throw them out !
No longer of use are they to you .
Master , moving rocks is one thing , but this is a little different .
Yes , but by what standard , ask I ?
Forget your old measures .
<unk> , heh , <unk> .
I thought I was in good shape .
It would be in seven pieces , were you a Jedi .
You will be , my young one .
Heh .
You will be .
I will not fail you .
I &apos;m not afraid .
You are reckless !
I have followed my feelings .
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment , the most serious mind .
Why not me ?
Ready are you ?
What know you of ready ?
I have trained Jedi for 800 years .
My own counsel I &apos;ll keep on who is to be trained .
There is no escape .
You must join me or die .
Don &apos;t make me destroy you here ...
The Emperor is strong with The Force .
But if you join me , together we could <unk> Him .
Do not resist .
It is our destiny !
No !
.... Never ....
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line .
You will <unk> great power ... Come , join with me !
Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor .
Time will tell .
All too easy .
Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought .
That won &apos;t be necessary .
I &apos;ll die first .
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you .
Come , The Emperor will complete your training .
Your future lies with us , Skywalker .
Now you will embrace the dark side .
Obi-wan knew this to be true .
And I too .
You &apos;ll find I &apos;m full of surprises .
The fear does not reach you .
You have learned more than I <unk> .
I want that ship .
It won &apos;t get through the <unk> .
Anything on the Millennium Falcon ?
<unk> ships destroyed , we don &apos;t know how many got away .
Make ready to land General <unk> &apos; assault troops on the surface .
Then <unk> the fleet so that nothing can get off that system .
You &apos;re in command now , Admiral <unk> .
Yes , My Lord .
Yes , Sir .... we have <unk> ... the System is supposed to be <unk> of human forms ...
The <unk> System ?
What d &apos;you mean , pretending ?
They are dressing .
Where &apos;d they get those clothes ?
They &apos;re ... pretending to dress .
Excuse me .
I didn &apos;t mean to disturb .... What am I saying ?
They <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> tells me that <unk> , like all <unk> , are vegetarian , sir .
Me , too .
Can &apos;t have a lot of monkeys making <unk> in the <unk> .
Have we fed them ?
Like raw steak or something ?
Yes , sir .
We &apos;re in luck .
The sick <unk> &apos;s almost empty except for a <unk> fox <unk> , a deer with pneumonia , and a depressed <unk> .
The <unk> will be hidden from the public .
They &apos;ll be <unk> .
If they want medical attention , it &apos;s available on the spot .
And the <unk> can start giving them the <unk> first thing in the morning .
General <unk> &apos;s very pleased .
Did you call the <unk> ?
That primitive <unk> can talk .
Nobody &apos;s going to believe it .
My name is Lewis -- Lewis <unk> .
My name is <unk> .
And this is <unk> -- my wife .
Do you have a name ?
We know that .
So am I.
And I mean you no harm .
A display of primitive <unk> -- And we can watch ... To a lot of psychiatric small talk -- I did not call her mad .
I <unk> asked her if she was .
And I repeat the question .
Are you mad ?
Dr. Milo , please don &apos;t call my wife mad .
<unk> , are you mad ?
And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it .
Only , since <unk> it , we have passed through a .... backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date <unk> clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship ?
-- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction .
That is another reason for keeping silence .
Our human <unk> would not be <unk> to know that , one day , their world will crack like an egg and fry to a <unk> , because of an Ape war of aggression .
But we saw Earth destroyed .
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth &apos;s future into Earth &apos;s past .
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in .
Then send him to <unk> .
He &apos;s a museum piece .
With particular <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> areas .
We shall want a full <unk> ...
Yes , but don &apos;t take any chances .
They look pretty <unk> .
Go easy , <unk> .
Security .
Join the <unk> and see the <unk> ... What are they doing here ?
I don &apos;t believe it .
No -- clothes .
<unk> , they changed into them .
There was a sort of <unk> in the ship .
I like you .
May I say something personal ?
I mean that in our &apos; primitive &apos; civilization , <unk> just don &apos;t talk .
I mean I think it &apos;s important that , when our &apos; primitive &apos; security <unk> are lifted , the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we &apos; <unk> &apos; call the Right People .
I &apos;m a psychiatrist .
I should .
I &apos;ve been doing it half my life to <unk> .
I mean he &apos;s of your race .
He &apos;s an Ape .
Look .
You don &apos;t have to be afraid .
We &apos;ve put him in chains and under <unk> .
Do you understand that ?
He &apos;s a <unk> .
But he isn &apos;t us .
He &apos;s your own kind .
C &apos;mon , Snake - it &apos;s L.A. Everything &apos;s phony , you know that .
You were injected with <unk> .
There is no <unk> 7 virus .
You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you .
Plissken , slow down the sub .
You &apos;re <unk> the power plant .
His <unk> &apos;s starting to <unk> .
Some areas have power - they &apos;re on line to San <unk> .
<unk> Third World connections .
They get weapons , drugs , fuel , <unk> - everything is pumped into the island from the south .
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare .
<unk> fighting for the right to rule .
It &apos;s a strain of the <unk> 7 virus .
<unk> <unk> .
100 % pure death .
Complete nervous system <unk> .
You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig .
Not a pretty sight .
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop .
She injected you with incentive <unk> .
Right now it &apos;s swimming in your <unk> .
It &apos;ll start to take effect in 9 hours .
<unk> became depressed after her mother &apos;s suicide , began to withdraw into her <unk> reality simulator .
She &apos;d punch up her own little world in <unk> and stay in it for days at a time .
Somebody else was in there with her .
Somehow during the tour , she came into possession of a prototype <unk> device .
We don &apos;t know how .
Zero emotional developments .
Total lack of compassion .
A highly developed <unk> instinct to survive .
Perfect for the mission .
Nobody else can pull it off - not an army , not a man .
<unk> did a <unk> on him .
Used a database of 5 million <unk> personalities .
He hit the bottom of the curve .
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones .
Not unless you give your life .
You fight till you &apos;re dead .
Then I forgive you .
Understand ?
Understand ?
You &apos;re my woman , you understand ?
You don &apos;t let anybody take you away from me without a fight .
Go on now .
Do as I say .
Are we going to eat soon ?
I &apos;m starved .
Now go get dressed .
We have things to do .
He doesn &apos;t look like his picture .
I bet he &apos;s fake .
You never heard of Snake Plissken ?
Cuervo , look out behind you !
You &apos;re stalling , Eddie .
Talk , you little <unk> !
It &apos;s so good to see you again .
I thought he was , but he came back .
You told me he was dead .
You &apos;re about to get hit , Cuervo .
It &apos;s Plissken .
Sure , Cuervo , but look here .
I &apos;ve done it all , man .
I killed Plissken , I got your girl back , I got it all .
Just for you , Cuervo .
Just for you .
You said I could be <unk> , Cuervo .
Your <unk> man .
Give it to me .
He jumped .
Down there .
He &apos;s dead , Cuervo .
I did it .
I killed Plissken .
Where is he ?
Come on , Cuervo .
I delivered him , didn &apos;t I ?
All I &apos;m asking for is what you promised .
My name is Hershe <unk> , do you understand , cowboy ?
Where &apos;d you get these <unk> , Carjack ?
You always were a loser , Plissken .
<unk> &apos; things up as you go along .
That &apos;s why I cut out on you in Cleveland .
You &apos;re just a bum like the rest of us .
I &apos;d like to get out but I don &apos;t have enough money .
Why should we leave ?
I love L.A. Where we gonna go ?
What &apos;s the payoff ?
Cuervo Jones has more <unk> than two <unk> .
No one gets near him .
Wait a minute .
All right .
Hold on .
We have a little arrangement .
Anything happens to me , you &apos;re dead .
I wouldn &apos;t be doin &apos; that , Snake .
My name is no longer Carjack .
Will you please get that through your fucking head ?
No .
The right <unk> &apos;s broken .
If I try to set it down she &apos;ll crash .
I have to stay in a <unk> you jump off .
Hey , Carjack .
We gotta hide the girl .
Give her your dress .
Can you land ?
I think we &apos;ve burned off enough fuel .
We may be <unk> enough to <unk> .
Just barely .
Somebody get off !
She &apos;s <unk> !
We &apos;re too heavy .
If I &apos;m late , Carjack , don &apos;t start without me .
See you in hell , Snake .
I don &apos;t know yet .
No , that sucks .
How are we getting out ?
You want to stay here , while Cuervo Jones rules the world ?
I don &apos;t know , sounds thin to me .
We get the girl and the prototype .
And we get out .
So what &apos;s the deal , gorgeous ?
Say goodnight , Carjack .
Dream on , blue eye .
Get me to Cuervo Jones .
Get me to the <unk> .
I got one hour .
I see your point .
What &apos;s the favor ?
I &apos;m already dead .
I got a new deal for you .
